# VLPRS — Vehicle Loan Processing & Receivables System

## One-Page Concept Note

---

### Sponsoring Office

Accountant General's Office, Oyo State Government

### Department

Car Loan Department (Vehicle Loan Committee)

---

### Problem Statement

The Vehicle Loan Scheme currently operates through paper-based records and fragmented Excel spreadsheets across 62 Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs), each with 50+ active loan holders. This manual regime has produced:

- **Over-deductions** beyond loan tenure — the single largest source of worker grievances
- **Calculation errors** in interest, balances, and installment tracking (verified in real MDA data)
- **File retrieval paralysis** — physical cabinets containing thousands of folders, creating delays and corruption opportunities
- **No single source of truth** — MDAs, the Car Loan Department, and payroll each hold different versions of the same data
- **Untracked retirement obligations** — staff retire with outstanding loans, and gratuity recovery is managed ad hoc
- **Revolving fund stagnation** — slow recoveries and poor visibility reduce the pool available for new applicants

---

### Proposed Solution

Deploy **VLPRS** — a secure, mobile-first, internal web application that serves as the single authoritative system of record for all vehicle loan processing, tracking, reconciliation, and receivables management.

VLPRS replaces manual calculation with automated computation, paper files with searchable digital records, and fragmented MDA spreadsheets with a centralised immutable ledger.

---

### Core Principle

> **MDAs submit facts. VLPRS computes truth. Reports are generated views.**

---

### Scope

| In Scope | Out of Scope |
|----------|-------------|
| Digitisation of all active and historical loan records | Direct payroll computation or execution |
| Automated loan lifecycle tracking (application to closure) | Direct gratuity payment processing |
| Monthly payroll reconciliation support | Loan policy changes (remains with Government) |
| Retirement & gratuity receivables management | |
| Role-based access for all stakeholders | |
| Public education portal & digital expression of interest | |
| Beneficiary self-service portal (Phase 2) | |

---

### Expected Outcomes

1. **Elimination of over-deduction** beyond loan tenure
2. **Faster resolution** of worker complaints via structured grievance tracking
3. **Audit-ready records** with full traceability
4. **Proactive retirement management** — advance visibility into upcoming obligations
5. **Improved fund rotation** — real-time visibility into repayments and available pool
6. **Reduced front-desk pressure** — searchable records replace physical file retrieval
7. **Corruption reduction** — transparent, tamper-resistant records remove bribery incentives

---

### Strategic Value

VLPRS strengthens financial controls, protects government workers' welfare, improves public trust in the scheme, supports the Accountant General's mandate for accurate loan administration, and provides the Vehicle Loan Committee with data-driven oversight for the first time.

---

### System Designation

VLPRS is classified as an **administrative support system**. It records and administers decisions — it does not make them. All loan approvals, rejections, and policy determinations remain the exclusive responsibility of the designated approval authorities.
