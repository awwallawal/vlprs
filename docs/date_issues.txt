❯ I noticed we missed something in the PRD which will have a cascading effect. Who is the best agent to help in this regards?                                                                                                                                                     
● Great question, Awwal. The BMad Master recommends checking what agents are available in your setup to give you the most accurate guidance. Let    me take a quick look at what's configured.

The BMad Master knows exactly who you need.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
  John, the Product Manager (PM) is your go-to agent for this. His role is specifically:                                                          
  
  "Product Manager specializing in collaborative PRD creation through user interviews, requirement discovery, and stakeholder alignment."                                                                                                                                                           
  John will help you identify what's missing, update the PRD properly, and think through the implications.

  Now, regarding the cascading effect — the BMad Master wants to flag something important. Depending on what was missed, updating the PRD may     
  require downstream updates to:

  1. Architecture docs — Winston (Architect) may need to revisit technical designs
  2. UX/wireframes — Sally (UX Designer) if it affects user flows
  3. Stories/backlog — Bob (Scrum Master) to update or create new stories
  4. Tech specs — If already created, they may need revision

  The BMad Master recommends this approach:

  1. Start with John (PM) to update the PRD and scope the impact of the missed item
  2. Then assess which downstream artifacts need updating based on the change

  Would you like the BMad Master to activate John (PM) for you via Party Mode, or would you prefer to work with him directly? Just say the word,  
  Awwal.

                                                                                                                                                    So you've spotted something missing in the PRD that's going to ripple downstream. Good catch — WHY did it take until now to surface? That's not 
  a blame question, that's a process question John files away for later. What matters now is getting it fixed right.

  You can type /bmad-help at any time if you need advice on what to do next. Combine it with your question like: /bmad-help where should I start  
  with an idea I have that does XYZ

  Here's what John can do for you:

  1. [MH] Redisplay Menu Help
  2. [CH] Chat with the Agent — about anything
  3. [CP] Create PRD — Expert-led facilitation to produce your Product Requirements Document
  4. [VP] Validate PRD — Validate a PRD is comprehensive, lean, well organized and cohesive
  5. [EP] Edit PRD — Update an existing Product Requirements Document
  6. [CE] Create Epics and Stories — Create the Epics and Stories Listing that will drive development
  7. [IR] Implementation Readiness — Ensure PRD, UX, Architecture, and Epics/Stories are all aligned
  8. [CC] Course Correction — Determine how to proceed if major changes are discovered mid-implementation
  9. [PM] Start Party Mode
  10. [DA] Dismiss Agent

  Given you need to update an existing PRD, John recommends [EP] Edit PRD — that's exactly what it's built for. But if you think the gap is so    
  significant it warrants a full course correction, [CC] might be the play.

  What'll it be, Awwal?

✻ Cogitated for 35s

❯ Can you read the PRD first so that when I make raise the issue you will have a clear grasp of the issue                                                                                                                                                    
● Smart move, Awwal. John always says — understand the terrain before you start digging. Let me find and read the PRD.

● John has read the entire PRD thoroughly, Awwal. All 866 lines — from the Executive Summary through every user journey, domain requirement,        functional requirement, and non-functional requirement.

  - 3-phase roadmap (MVP → Growth → Vision)
  - 4-tier computation engine, immutable ledger, 63 MDAs, 3,100+ loans
  - The post-validation edit history from Feb 14

  John is ready. What did you catch that was missed? Lay it on me — WHY does it matter, and which part of the system does it touch?

❯ We only looked at the 60 month full loan tenure with the assumption that staffs have more than sixty months to use within the service. Even     
   at that I believe we need to have a way (column) dedicated to knowing the retirement date of all staff(s) entering the loan pool. we know     
  they have a 17 column spreadsheet currently in use that explicitly believe staff(s) have more months to use in the service than the loan          tenure. How do we track this because if we don't track it how can we interface with the Pensions/Gratuity Committee on the future              
  obligations that would arise from the car loan to be deducted from the enititlements. Also, for the other cases of                                Deceased/Suspended/Absconded/Early Exit and others we need a way to track the dates so that we can forecast/analyse/group/filter and do all    
   manipulations on theses and other information as it relates to the staff record. Finally this cascades to the dashboard as the AG cannot       
  have a true position if the dates for actions such as the retirement date in the future and other dates that affect data manipulation are       
  not recorded somehow. So how do we bring this in considering this has not been tracked in the PRD to be built into the system or is it          
  tracked somehow and I don't know. I hope my word vomit/rant can make sense to you. Thoughts (make it better).                                                                                                                                                                                     ● Awwal, your "word vomit" makes perfect sense. John loves this kind of rant because it reveals a foundational data gap that would have haunted us   in production. Let me break down what you've actually uncovered.                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                  
  What You Found — It's Bigger Than You Think                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                    You've identified not one issue but three interconnected gaps:                                                                                  

  Gap 1: Staff Temporal Data is Missing from the Data Model

  The PRD tracks loan lifecycle states (FR14) and event flags in submissions, but flags are binary — "RETIRED: yes/no." What's missing is WHEN:   

  - Retirement date — knowable at loan origination (date of birth + 60, or date of first appointment + 35 years)
  - Date of event for Deceased, Suspended, Absconded, Transfer, Dismissal, etc.
  - Date of birth and date of first appointment — the source data needed to compute retirement date

  Without dates, you have facts without a timeline. And a financial system without a timeline is blind.

  Gap 2: The Computation Engine Can't Handle Tenure > Remaining Service

  Right now FR1-FR6 assume a clean 60-month runway. But what happens when:

  - A staff member has 36 months to retirement and gets a 60-month loan?
  - The remaining 24 months become a receivable against gratuity
  - The system needs to know this AT APPROVAL TIME, not when it happens

  The 17-column spreadsheet assumes everyone has enough service time. VLPRS should be smarter than the spreadsheet, not replicate its blind spot. 

  Gap 3: The AG Dashboard Shows Incomplete Exposure

  If the AG sees "Total Exposure: ₦1.84B" but doesn't know that ₦340M of that will shift from payroll deduction to gratuity recovery in the next  
  12 months — she's making decisions on incomplete data. The "30-Second Truth" becomes a "30-Second Partial Truth."

  John's Recommendation

  Here's what John thinks we need to add to the PRD:

  1. Staff Temporal Profile (New Data Requirement — MVP)
  - Date of birth, date of first appointment, computed retirement date
  - These are captured at loan origination and stored in the Loan Master
  - Retirement date is derived but can be overridden (early retirement, extension)

  2. Employment Event Log (Elevate from Phase 2 to MVP)
  - The "13-status Employment Status Taxonomy" is currently Phase 2 — but the DATE-BEARING version of key statuses (Retired, Deceased, Suspended, 
  Absconded, Transferred, Dismissed, LWOP) needs to be MVP
  - Each event: type, effective date, reporting date, reported by, supporting reference

  3. Tenure Validation at Approval (New FR — MVP)
  - System computes remaining service months from retirement date
  - If loan tenure > remaining service: flag it, compute the split (payroll months vs gratuity receivable months)
  - Committee sees this clearly before approving

  4. Dashboard Enhancement (MVP)
  - "Retirement Pipeline" as a headline or attention item — loans where payroll deductions will end due to retirement within 3/6/12 months        
  - Gratuity receivable exposure amount

  5. Gratuity Receivable Tracking (MVP — Basic)
  - For loans where tenure exceeds remaining service: track the projected gratuity receivable amount
  - This doesn't require the full "Retirement-Gratuity Handshake Protocol" (that stays Phase 2) — just the TRACKING of the obligation

  ---
  This is a significant PRD update, Awwal. John doesn't want to just patch it — he wants to do it right through the Edit PRD workflow so every FR,
   NFR, and journey that's affected gets updated systematically.

  Want John to fire up [EP] Edit PRD and work through these changes with you? Or do you want to refine the scope of what should be MVP vs Phase 2 
  first?

✻ Crunched for 55s

❯ Before firing the EP up we need to know how the MDA Accounting Officers report this. What is the best way to collect this information and       
  how do we validate it?

                                                                                                                                                    What you're really asking about is two fundamentally different kinds of data:

  └───────────────────────────┴───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┴───────────────────────┘

  This data doesn't change monthly. It's captured ONCE per staff member and lives on the loan record permanently. The question is: who provides it
   and when?

  Type 2: Employment Event Data (Unknown Until It Happens)

  This data arrives when the event happens — not on a monthly schedule. The question is: do we bolt it onto the monthly submission or create a    
  separate channel?

  ---
  The Collection Design Decision

  John sees three realistic approaches. Let's think through each:

  Approach A: Expand the Monthly CSV (7 or 8 Fields)

  Add Event Date as a 7th field. When Event Flag = NONE, Event Date is blank. When Event Flag = RETIRED, Event Date = the effective retirement    
  date.

  Pros:
  - Minimal training change — MDA officers already know the CSV flow
  - Single submission channel — no new interface to learn
  - Event date rides alongside the event flag naturally

  Cons:
  - Event reporting is now tied to the monthly submission cycle. If someone dies on the 2nd and the submission isn't due until the 28th, the event
   waits 26 days
  - Doesn't solve the static profile data (DOB, appointment date) — that's not a monthly field

  Approach B: Two-Track Collection

  Track 1 — Staff Profile (once, at migration or loan onboarding):
  - Department Admin (Mr. Okonkwo) enters DOB and first appointment date for each staff member
  - During migration: added to the migration spreadsheet as required columns
  - For new loans post-MVP: captured during loan setup
  - Retirement date computed automatically by the system

  Track 2 — Employment Event Report (separate from monthly submission):
  - A simple form: Staff ID, Event Type, Effective Date, Supporting Reference (letter number, etc.), Notes
  - Available to MDA Reporting Officers anytime — not tied to the monthly cycle
  - Department Admin can also file events (since they're the ones who often get the call)

  Monthly CSV stays at 6 fields. Clean, simple, unchanged.

  Pros:
  - MDA officers' monthly workflow stays simple — the 6-field win is preserved
  - Events can be reported AS THEY HAPPEN, not on a monthly cycle
  - Profile data is collected once properly, not repeated monthly
  - Separation of concerns — facts vs events

  Cons:
  - Two interfaces for MDA officers to learn (monthly submission + event reporting)
  - Risk that MDA officers forget to report events separately

  Approach C: Hybrid — Expand CSV + Separate Event Form

  CSV becomes 7 fields (add Event Date). BUT also provide a standalone event reporting form for mid-cycle events. The monthly submission catches  
  anything the standalone form missed.

  Pros:
  - Belt and suspenders — events can be reported immediately OR caught in the monthly cycle
  - If the standalone form is skipped, the CSV is the safety net

  Cons:
  - Potential duplicate reporting (event filed via form AND via CSV)
  - More complexity

  ---
  John's Recommendation: Approach B (Two-Track) — Here's WHY

  The 6-field monthly CSV is one of VLPRS's greatest design wins. It's what takes Mrs. Adebayo from 3 hours to 12 minutes. John does NOT want to  
  compromise that simplicity. Every field you add to the monthly submission increases friction for 63 officers, 12 months a year.

  Employment events are episodic, not periodic. A retirement happens once. A death happens once. These are not monthly rhythms — they're
  interruptions. They deserve their own simple, purpose-built channel.

  Here's what John proposes:

  Staff Profile Data (Track 1):
  - During migration: Mr. Okonkwo adds DOB and date of first appointment to the migration spreadsheet (he has access to personnel files)
  - For new loans: Committee approval workflow requires DOB and appointment date before loan can be created
  - System computes retirement date automatically
  - Department Admin can correct if needed (e.g., approved service extension)

  Employment Event Reporting (Track 2):
  - Simple form available to MDA Reporting Officers and Department Admin
  - 5 fields: Staff ID, Event Type (dropdown), Effective Date, Reference Number (optional), Notes (optional)
  - Available anytime — not tied to submission cycle
  - System sends confirmation: "Event recorded for Staff ID XXXX. Loan status updated."

  Monthly CSV stays at 6 fields. But the system cross-checks: if the monthly submission shows zero deduction for a staff member AND no employment 
  event has been filed, the system flags it as "Missing Event — possible unreported status change." This is your safety net.

  ---
  Validation — How Do We Trust the Data?

  Data Point: Date of Birth
  Validation Method: Format validation + reasonableness check (age 18-65 at loan approval). Cross-reference: does retirement date fall BEFORE loan

    end date? If yes, flag for committee.
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Data Point: Date of First Appointment
  Validation Method: Format validation + reasonableness (not before age 18, not in the future). Cross-check: appointment date + 35 years should   
    roughly align with DOB + 60 years for consistency.
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Data Point: Computed Retirement Date
  Validation Method: System-derived — no manual input. Recomputed if DOB or appointment date is corrected. Rule: earlier of (DOB + 60 years) or   
    (first appointment + 35 years).
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Data Point: Employment Event Date
  Validation Method: Cannot be in the future (except scheduled retirement). Cannot be before the last recorded deduction (you can't retire before 
    your last pay day). If event date > 90 days in the past, flag as "Late Report" for Department Admin review.
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Data Point: Event + Deduction Cross-check
  Validation Method: If event filed but deductions still arriving — flag ("Deductions continuing after reported retirement"). If no event filed   
  but
    deductions stopped — flag ("Unreported status change").
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Data Point: Retirement vs Tenure
  Validation Method: At loan approval: if retirement date < loan end date, system computes and displays the split (payroll months vs gratuity     
    receivable months). Committee sees this BEFORE approving.

  The key insight: the system validates by cross-referencing data streams against each other. The MDA says one thing in the monthly submission,   
  another thing in the event report, and the math says a third thing. When these don't align, the system surfaces it. Trust then verify — the same
   philosophy already in the PRD.

  What do you think, Awwal? Does the Two-Track approach feel right for how MDAs actually work? Or does John need to rethink this? Once we align on
   the collection model, THEN we fire up the Edit PRD workflow and bake it in properly.

✻ Baked for 1m 14s

❯ I would prefer C, let the field be increased to capture the date issue (Government Staff can be funny and we should not give an excuse for      
  under-reporting where they would say they forgot. Let it be right in their face) and also if any issue happens before the reporting date it    
   can be reported in the separate flow and if they don't report it there, the monthly submission flow would remind them to fill all                important dates information. Thoughts (make it better)

You know your users better than any persona doc ever could. "Don't give them an excuse" — that's not just UX,        that's governance design. Let me refine Approach C into something bulletproof.                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                  
  Refined Approach C: The Monthly Checkpoint + Mid-Cycle Event Channel                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                    The Core Principle                                                                                                                              

  The monthly submission isn't just a data dump — it becomes a monthly accountability checkpoint. Every month, 63 MDA officers are FORCED to look 
  at their staff records and confirm status. The separate event form handles urgency. The monthly CSV handles compliance. Belt AND suspenders.

  WHY field 8? Because this closes the loophole. Right now, an MDA officer can submit ₦0 with Event Flag = NONE and nobody asks questions. Field 8
   forces them to explain: "Leave Without Pay," "Payroll Error," "Awaiting Salary Reinstatement," etc. No more silent zeros.

  The Mrs. Adebayo impact: She goes from 6 fields to... still mostly 6. For her 47 staff where everyone is paying normally, fields 7 and 8 are    
  blank. She only fills them when something happened. The cognitive load increase is near zero for the happy path, but it's right in their face   
  when something requires attention.

  The Monthly Submission Checkpoint Screen

  Here's where it gets powerful. Before the MDA officer uploads their CSV or submits manually, the system shows a pre-submission checkpoint:      

  Pre-Submission Review — February 2026

  Before submitting, please review the following staff requiring attention:

  Approaching Retirement (next 12 months):
  - Staff 4412 — Adamu B.K. — Retirement: August 2026 (6 months)
  - Staff 7201 — Bello H.M. — Retirement: November 2026 (9 months)

  Previously Flagged — No Deduction Last Month:
  - Staff 3301 — Ogunyemi F.A. — Zero deduction in January. No event filed. Please update.

  Mid-Cycle Events Already Reported:
  - Staff 2847 — Musa K.R. — TRANSFERRED reported on Feb 3. Please confirm in this submission.

  ☐ I confirm I have reviewed the above and my submission reflects the current status of all staff.

  They CANNOT submit until they tick that confirmation. Every unreported issue is staring them in the face. No excuses.

  ---
  Mid-Cycle Event Report Form (Separate Channel)

  Available anytime, not tied to monthly cycle. For when events can't wait:

  Field: Staff ID
  Required: Yes
  Notes: Lookup shows staff name + MDA for confirmation
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Field: Event Type
  Required: Yes
  Notes: Dropdown: Retired, Deceased, Suspended, Absconded, Transferred Out, Dismissed, LWOP Start, LWOP End, Service Extension
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Field: Effective Date
  Required: Yes
  Notes: The date the event actually took/takes effect
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Field: Reference Number
  Required: Conditional
  Notes: Required for: Retirement (retirement letter ref), Transfer (transfer letter ref), Dismissal (dismissal letter ref). Optional for others. 
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Field: Notes
  Required: Optional
  Notes: Free text for context

  After submission: System immediately updates the staff's status. The NEXT monthly submission checkpoint will show this event and ask the MDA    
  officer to confirm it in their CSV. If they don't — flag it.

  Cross-Validation Engine (The Safety Net)

  This is where the two tracks reinforce each other:

  Scenario: Event filed mid-cycle, CSV confirms same event + date
  System Response: Matched. No action needed.
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Scenario: Event filed mid-cycle, CSV shows different date
  System Response: Flag: "Date discrepancy — mid-cycle report says Jan 15, monthly submission says Jan 22. Department Admin to reconcile."        
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Scenario: Event filed mid-cycle, CSV shows no event for that staff
  System Response: Flag: "Unreported event — mid-cycle event filed but monthly submission does not reflect it."
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Scenario: CSV shows event, no mid-cycle report was filed
  System Response: Accepted — the monthly CSV caught it. System records event.
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Scenario: CSV shows ₦0 + Event Flag NONE + no Cessation Reason
  System Response: Rejected — "Row 12: Amount is ₦0 with no Event Flag or Cessation Reason. Please explain why no deduction was made."
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Scenario: No deduction for 2+ months, no event filed anywhere
  System Response: Attention item → Deputy AG's dashboard. Auto-flag as "Inactive — Unreported."
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Scenario: Staff approaching retirement (< 6 months), no event filed
  System Response: Monthly checkpoint shows it. If no event filed by T-3 months before computed retirement date, escalate to Department Admin.    

  ---
  Staff Profile Data — The One-Time Collection

  The monthly CSV handles ongoing events. But the STATIC profile data (DOB, appointment date) still needs to be collected once. John proposes:    

  During Migration (Existing 3,100+ Staff):
  - Migration spreadsheet adds two required columns: Date of Birth, Date of First Appointment
  - Mr. Okonkwo sources from personnel files (he has access)
  - System computes retirement date from these
  - If DOB or appointment date is missing: record is flagged as "Profile Incomplete" — migration proceeds but loan shows an amber indicator until 
  resolved

  For New Loans (Post-MVP):
  - Loan setup requires DOB and appointment date before the loan record can be created
  - Committee approval screen shows: "Remaining service: 48 months. Loan tenure: 60 months. 12 months gratuity receivable."
  - Non-negotiable — no profile data, no loan record

  For Profile Corrections:
  - Department Admin can update DOB or appointment date with a correction workflow (old value, new value, reason, supporting reference)
  - Retirement date automatically recomputes
  - Any affected loan tenure calculations update accordingly

  This is the complete collection and validation model, Awwal. The monthly CSV is the forcing function. The mid-cycle form is the urgency channel.
   The cross-validation engine catches everything that falls through. And the pre-submission checkpoint puts it RIGHT IN THEIR FACE.

  Ready to fire up [EP] Edit PRD and bake all of this in? Or do you want to refine anything else before we commit?

That file is just our conversation transcript — no new clues there for the tugging thought. But your MDA historical upload idea? That's         
  significant. Let John unpack it before we dive in.
                                                                                                                                                    MDA Historical Upload — WHY This Matters
                                                                                                                                                  
  You're saying: don't make Mr. Okonkwo the sole bottleneck for getting data into the system. Let the 63 MDA officers ALSO upload their historical
   monthly records.

  This is powerful because:

  - Mr. Okonkwo has the central view — but each MDA officer has THEIR version of the truth in their 17-column spreadsheets
  - If both upload independently, the system can cross-validate — where do central records and MDA records agree? Where do they diverge?
  - Historical monthly records reveal actual deduction timelines — when did deductions start, stop, change? This reconstructs event histories that
   were never formally reported
  - It distributes the migration workload — 63 officers uploading their own data vs one man doing everything

  John thinks this should be a parallel migration track: Mr. Okonkwo uploads centrally, MDA officers upload their historical records, and the     
  system reconciles the two. Variances become the investigation list.

  The Thing Tugging at You

  John has a hunch. Could it be this: staff who are ALREADY past their computed retirement date but still showing active deductions? If we bring  
  in DOB and appointment dates during migration, the system might immediately discover that 50-100 staff should have stopped being deducted months
   or years ago. That's not a future problem — that's a DAY ONE discovery. That's the kind of thing that makes an AG's phone ring.

  If that's not it, park it. It'll surface. These things always do once the edit is underway.

  thought surfaced yet?

✻ Churned for 1m 57s

❯ You raised something else with your hunch which is "ghost workers" how can someone be supposedly retired/past retirement date and still be      
  drawing salary                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                  ● NOW we're getting somewhere, Awwal. John thinks THIS might be what was tugging at you.
                                                                                                                                                    The Ghost Worker Detection — An Emergent Capability                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
  Here's what's powerful: VLPRS wasn't designed as a ghost worker detection system. But the MOMENT you put DOB and appointment dates into the Loan   Master, it BECOMES one — at least within the car loan pool.                                                                                    

  Think about what happens on Day One of migration:

  1. Mr. Okonkwo uploads 3,100+ records with DOB and appointment dates
  2. System computes retirement date for every single staff member
  3. System instantly flags: "47 staff members have computed retirement dates BEFORE today's date but are showing active loan deductions"

  Each one of those 47 is one of three things:

  Scenario: Legitimate extension
  Explanation: Staff got approved service extension beyond 60/35 years
  System Response: MDA should provide extension reference number. System records override with documentation.
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Scenario: Administrative oversight
  Explanation: Staff retired but MDA never reported it. Deductions still being posted from payroll inertia.
  System Response: MDA needs to file retirement event. System flags for immediate resolution. Potential over-deduction recovery.
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Scenario: Ghost worker
  Explanation: Staff left service. Someone is still drawing salary and "deductions" are being reported for a person who doesn't exist on the      
    payroll anymore.
  System Response: Escalation to AG. This isn't a loan issue — it's a payroll integrity issue VLPRS has surfaced.

  The AG doesn't just get loan visibility. She gets a canary in the coal mine for payroll integrity across 63 MDAs.

  WHY This Is Politically Sensitive — And Why Design Matters

  John needs to flag something: in Nigerian government context, "ghost worker" is a loaded term. Accusations fly, people get defensive,
  investigations get political. VLPRS must surface this data WITHOUT becoming a witch-hunting tool.

  The same non-punitive design philosophy already in the PRD applies here:

  - Never call it "ghost worker detection" — call it "Post-Retirement Activity Alert" or "Service Status Verification"
  - The language: "Staff ID 4412 — computed retirement date: March 2025. Active deductions recorded through February 2026. Verification required: 
  service extension or status update needed."
  - No accusation. No blame. Just: "the math says this person should have retired. Please explain why deductions continue."
  - The MDA can respond with a service extension reference, a retirement event filing, or an investigation request

  What This Adds to the PRD

  #: 14
  New Requirement: Post-Retirement Activity Detection — During migration AND ongoing monthly processing, system flags any staff with active       
    deductions whose computed retirement date is in the past
  Type: New FR
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  #: 15
  New Requirement: Service Extension Override — Department Admin can record a service extension with reference number, new expected retirement    
    date, and approving authority, overriding the computed date
  Type: New FR
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  #: 16
  New Requirement: Dashboard: Service Status Verification Queue — New attention item category: staff with past-retirement deductions requiring MDA

    verification (separate from normal exceptions)
  Type: FR33 enhancement
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  #: 17
  New Requirement: Migration: Immediate Retirement Scan — As part of migration processing, system generates a "Service Status Verification Report"

    listing all staff past computed retirement date
  Type: FR25-31 enhancement

  This brings our total edit scope to 17 items.

  Awwal — is THIS the thing that was tugging? The ghost worker angle? And here's John's real question: how sensitive is this politically? Because 
  the way we frame it in the PRD determines how the AG positions it. Does she WANT this capability surfaced prominently, or does she want it as a 
  quiet back-channel report only visible to Super Admin?

✻ Worked for 48s                                                                                                                                     
❯ It is not the thing tugging but your perspective opened up another thing. She doesnot want this capability but we must surface it both for      
  her and her deputy. If is there we surface it and if it is not there it is all well and good but the ability must be there I believe.          
  Thoughts (make it better)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
● John agrees completely. Here's the right design principle:                                                                                        
  Passive Truth Surfacing — Not Active Hunting                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                  
  The system doesn't "detect ghost workers." The system computes retirement dates and displays attention items when the math doesn't add up.        That's it. It's the same philosophy as every other variance in VLPRS.                                                                           

  The framing in the PRD should be:

  - It's NOT a named feature. There's no "Ghost Worker Detection" in the feature list.
  - It's a natural consequence of having temporal data + the computation engine + the attention items system that already exists
  - Post-retirement activity is just another attention item type alongside "growing variance," "missed submission," "inactive loan"
  - If zero staff are past retirement with active deductions — the item simply never appears on the dashboard. Quiet. Clean.
  - If 47 staff are flagged — it shows up like any other amber/red item. The AG sees it. The Deputy investigates it. Standard workflow.

  The system doesn't look for problems. It computes truth. If truth reveals a problem, it doesn't look away either.

  That's already the DNA of VLPRS. We're just extending it to temporal data.

  So let me revise item 14 in our edit scope:

  ~~Post-Retirement Activity Detection (new feature)~~
  → Enhance existing Attention Items (FR33) to include: "Active deductions recorded for staff past computed retirement date — service status      
  verification required." Visible to Super Admin and Department Admin. Appears only when applicable.

  One line in the attention items definition. Not a feature. A consequence of truth.

  ---
  Now Awwal — that thing is STILL tugging. Let me throw a few possibilities at you. Sometimes hearing the wrong answer shakes the right one loose:

  - What happens financially when someone dies/absconds mid-loan? The outstanding balance becomes a receivable against... who? Estate? Guarantor? 
  Written off? Each event type has a different financial consequence the system needs to compute.
  - Pro-rated deductions? If someone retires on the 15th of the month, is the last deduction full or partial?
  - Who takes over when an MDA Reporting Officer themselves leaves? Succession/handover for the submission role itself.
  - Can a staff member have more than one loan in the legacy data? The policy says no, but legacy data might say otherwise.

  Any of those ring a bell? Or is it something else entirely? Don't force it — it'll come. Let's keep moving and it'll surface. Should John       
  proceed to the deep review step and start drafting the edits?

✻ Sautéed for 46s

❯ I think it is the date for those who want an early exit from the loan. Remember we said at early exit the remaining principal is computed       
  and paid including the month interest. If there staff(s) opting for the early loan exit we must also be able to track this. For the            
  Deceased and Abscond i think we have made provision for that with the deduction from the death entitlements and gaurantor repayment. There        is no pro-rated deduction as it is based on month. Yes the succession plan we must give the "Mr Okonkwo" a user management ability same as     
  the Ag/Deputy but they would most likely not be direct operators of the feature. Let's see what the legacy data surfaces with respect to          multiple loan as currently not all staff submit their staff id, we must allow the MDA Accounting Officers/Mr Okonkwo to post/update the        
  Staff ID for staff(s) that haven't submitted it before so Mr Okonkwo can search system wide and update and each MDA Accounting Officer can      
  post/update for their staff the AG/Deputy can also search system wide. Thoughts (make it better)                                                                                                                                                                                                  ● THERE it is, Awwal. The tugging thought was early exit date tracking. And you've just surfaced TWO more gaps (user management + Staff ID          management) in the same breath. Let me unpack all three.                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                  
  1. Early Exit Date Tracking — The Missing Workflow                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                    The PRD mentions early exit simulation (Journey 4 — Mr. Okonkwo shows Alhaja Musa her payoff amount). But it's a SIMULATION only. There's no    
  tracked workflow for when someone actually COMMITS to early exit.

  What's missing is the lifecycle:

  ┌─────────────┬────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────┐  
  │    Stage    │                                      What Happens                                      │            Date Tracked             │  
  ├─────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────┤  
  │ Request     │ Staff expresses intent to exit early (walk-in or MDA reports it)                       │ Request date                        │  
  ├─────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────┤  
  │ Computation │ System computes: remaining principal + current month interest = lump sum payoff amount │ Computation date + valid-until date │  
  ├─────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────┤  
  │ Commitment  │ Staff confirms they will pay. Amount is locked for a defined period.                   │ Commitment date + payment deadline  │  
  ├─────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────┤  
  │ Payment     │ Lump sum received and recorded in the ledger                                           │ Payment date                        │  
  ├─────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────┤  
  │ Closure     │ Loan marked as Completed — Early Exit. Auto-Stop Certificate generated.                │ Closure date                        │  
  └─────────────┴────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┴─────────────────────────────────────┘  

  WHY dates matter here:
  - The payoff amount changes every month as interest accrues — so a computation done in February is invalid in March
  - If 12 staff have pending early exit commitments totaling ₦4.8M, the AG needs to see that as incoming fund recovery on her dashboard
  - Mr. Okonkwo needs to chase staff who committed but haven't paid by the deadline
  - The computation must have an expiry — "This payoff amount is valid until March 28, 2026. After this date, a new computation is required."     

  This feeds the dashboard: "Pending Early Exits: 12 staff, ₦4.8M expected recovery" — that's real money the AG can plan around.

  2. User Management — The Succession Gap

  The PRD has RBAC (who can do what) but NOT user lifecycle management (who creates/disables/reassigns accounts). If an MDA Reporting Officer     
  retires or transfers, someone needs to:

  - Deactivate the old officer's account
  - Create a new officer's account
  - Assign the new officer to the correct MDA
  - Ensure no submission gap during transition

  Here's the access model:

  ┌──────────────────────────────────────┬────────────────────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │              Capability              │ Department Admin (Mr. Okonkwo) │                Super Admin (AG/Deputy)                 │
  ├──────────────────────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
  │ Create MDA Reporting Officer account │ Yes — primary operator         │ Yes — has capability, rarely uses directly             │
  ├──────────────────────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
  │ Deactivate account                   │ Yes                            │ Yes                                                    │

  Mr. Okonkwo is the day-to-day operator of user management. The AG/Deputy have the keys but don't turn them unless they need to. This is
  consistent with the existing "system informs, humans decide" philosophy — and with how government admin actually works.

  3. Staff ID Management — The Data Quality Foundation

  This is critical, Awwal. If not all staff have Staff IDs in the legacy data, then Staff ID cannot be the sole identifier at migration time. The 
  system needs to handle this gracefully:

  The problem: Legacy spreadsheets may have staff names but missing Staff IDs. You can't reject these records — that's real loan data. But you    
  can't search or deduplicate without a unique identifier.

  The solution:

  Aspect: Internal ID
  Design: System generates a unique VLPRS Loan Reference (e.g., VLC-2024-0847) for every record — this is the TRUE unique key, always present     
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Aspect: Staff ID
  Design: Optional at migration, but flagged as "Profile Incomplete" until provided
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Aspect: Search
  Design: Search works on: VLPRS Reference, Staff ID, Staff Name, MDA — so records without Staff ID are still findable
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Aspect: Staff ID Update
  Design: Can be added/updated after migration as records are enriched

  Who can update Staff IDs:

  ┌────────────────────────────────┬────────────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │              Role              │         Scope          │                                     Rationale                                      │
  ├────────────────────────────────┼────────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
  │ MDA Reporting Officer          │ Their MDA's staff only │ They know their people — they can provide the Staff ID from HR records             │
  ├────────────────────────────────┼────────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
  │ Department Admin (Mr. Okonkwo) │ System-wide            │ He's the cross-MDA authority — can search, find duplicates, and reconcile          │
  ├────────────────────────────────┼────────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
  │ Super Admin (AG/Deputy)        │ System-wide            │ Supervisory capability — same as Mr. Okonkwo's scope but rarely exercised directly │
  └────────────────────────────────┴────────────────────────┴────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

  Validation on Staff ID updates:
  - Duplicate check: "This Staff ID is already assigned to another loan record. Please verify." — prevents two loans mapping to one person (or    
  catches genuine duplicates in legacy data)
  - Format validation: whatever the Oyo State staff ID format is
  - Audit trail: old value, new value, who changed it, when, why

  Dashboard impact: "Records Missing Staff ID: 284 of 3,147 (9%)" — tracked as a data quality metric that should trend toward zero over the first 
  few months.

  That's a substantial but coherent set of edits, Awwal. Every item traces back to a real operational need you've identified. Shall John proceed  
  to the deep review step and start writing these into the PRD? Or is there anything else surfacing?

✻ Worked for 1m 19s

❯ proceed because adding more at this point may mean we have to start writing the PRD again laughing out loudly!                                  
                                                                                                                 
● Ha! John hears you, Awwal. 21 edits is already a significant surgery — let's stitch before we add more incisions!

  Deep Review Complete — Change Plan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
  PRD Current State: BMAD Standard format, 866 lines, rated 4/5 in validation. Already edited once (Feb 14) adding FR53-FR59. Well-structured,
  information-dense, zero anti-patterns. The edits we're proposing address foundational data model gaps that ripple across multiple sections.     

  Validation Report Findings Being Addressed:
  - Moderate Gap #3: Financial integrity metrics — retirement receivables tracking ✓
  - Moderate Gap #5: Retirement pipeline forecasting elevated from Phase 2 ✓

  Edit Requirements: 21 items from our discussion, mapped below.

  ---
  Proposed Change Plan — By Section

  Section 1: Executive Summary (lines 36-75)

  - Current State: Solid. Vision, core problem, differentiator, target users.
  - Changes Needed:
    - Update Target Users table — add note that Department Admin has user management authority
    - Minor: note that MDA officers submit 8 fields (not 6) — this number appears in the Executive Summary's product differentiator description   
  - Priority: Medium
  - Edit Items: #18 (user management)

  Section 2: Success Criteria (lines 77-156)

  - Current State: Strong success criteria but missing temporal/retirement metrics
  - Changes Needed:
    - Add to Measurable Outcomes: Staff ID completion rate (trending toward 100%)
    - Add to Measurable Outcomes: Early exit processing time (request to closure)
    - Add to Measurable Outcomes: Service status verification resolution rate
    - Add to Business Success: Retirement pipeline visibility milestone
    - Validation gap closure: retirement receivables tracking metric, fund rotation rate
  - Priority: High
  - Edit Items: #7, #8, #13, #16, #17, #21

  Section 3: Product Scope & Phased Development (lines 159-271)

  - Current State: 10 MVP features, clean build sequence. Employment Status Taxonomy is Phase 2.
  - Changes Needed:
    - MVP Feature Set: Add feature 11: "Staff Temporal Profile & Employment Event Tracking" — DOB, appointment date, computed retirement date,    
  event lifecycle with dates, mid-cycle event reporting
    - MVP Feature Set: Add feature 12: "User & Staff Record Management" — user lifecycle management, Staff ID management, MDA historical upload   
    - Build Sequence: Insert Staff Temporal Profile after RBAC (step 3) and before Migration (step 4) — migration depends on having the temporal  
  data model
    - Phase 2 reclassification: Move date-bearing employment events (Retired, Deceased, Suspended, Absconded, Transferred, Dismissed, LWOP) from  
  the 13-status taxonomy to MVP. Leave the FULL taxonomy (all 13 statuses with detailed workflow rules) in Phase 2.
    - MVP User Journey Coverage: Update table for new coverage
    - Risk Mitigation: Add data quality risk (incomplete Staff IDs, missing DOB data in legacy records)
  - Priority: Critical
  - Edit Items: #1, #9, #10, #12, #16, #18, #19

  Section 4: User Journeys (lines 273-568)

  - Current State: 10 rich journeys. Key journeys affected: 3 (Migration), 4 (Daily Ops), 5 (Happy Path)
  - Changes Needed:

  - Journey 3 — Mr. Okonkwo Migration (lines 328-361):
    - Add: migration spreadsheet now requires DOB and date of first appointment columns
    - Add: system computes retirement date and flags staff already past retirement ("Service Status Verification" items)
    - Add: MDA officers can upload their own historical monthly records for cross-validation
    - Add to Requirements Revealed: temporal profile fields, historical upload capability, post-retirement activity flagging

  Journey 4 — Mr. Okonkwo Daily Ops (lines 364-388):
    - Expand the early exit scene: Alhaja Musa doesn't just simulate — she COMMITS. Show the full early exit workflow: computation → expiry date →
   commitment → payment → closure
    - Add: Mr. Okonkwo creates a new MDA officer account when the old officer at Ministry of Works retires (user management scene)
    - Add: Mr. Okonkwo updates Staff IDs for records flagged as incomplete
    - Add to Requirements Revealed: early exit workflow with date tracking, user lifecycle management, Staff ID update capability

  Journey 5 — Mrs. Adebayo Happy Path (lines 392-419):
    - Update: CSV is now 8 fields (add Event Effective Date, Deduction Cessation Reason)
    - Add: pre-submission checkpoint screen showing staff approaching retirement, previously flagged items, mid-cycle events to confirm
    - Add: confirmation checkbox before upload
    - Note: for the happy path, fields 7 and 8 are blank — cognitive load stays near zero
    - Update: "6 fields of fact" becomes "8 fields" throughout the journey
    - Add to Requirements Revealed: 8-field CSV, pre-submission checkpoint, confirmation requirement

  Journey 6 — Mrs. Adebayo Error Recovery (lines 422-447):
    - Add: new error case — "Row 29: Amount is ₦0 with no Event Flag or Cessation Reason. Please explain why no deduction was made."
    - Add to Requirements Revealed: conditional field validation, zero-amount explanation requirement
  - Priority: Critical
  - Edit Items: #1, #3, #9, #10, #11, #16, #18, #19

  Section 5: Domain-Specific Requirements (lines 571-640)

  - Current State: Comprehensive. NDPR, financial administration, audit, technical constraints, integration.
  - Changes Needed:
    - Financial Data Integrity: add temporal data integrity requirement — retirement date computation must be deterministic and auditable
    - Integration Requirements: note that MDA historical data upload creates a reconciliation pathway (not external integration, but internal     
  cross-validation)
  - Priority: Low
  - Edit Items: #1, #9

  Section 6: Web Application Specific Requirements (lines 643-705)

  - Current State: Complete. No changes needed.
  - Priority: None

  Section 7: Functional Requirements (lines 708-797)

  - Current State: FR1-FR59. This section takes the heaviest edit load.
  - Changes Needed:

  - Modifications to Existing FRs:

  | FR   | Change

   zero-amount rejection when neither provided
     | #2                |
  | FR25 | Migration requires DOB + appointment date columns. Records with missing temporal data flagged as "Profile Incomplete" — migration      
  proceeds with amber indicator
          | #10               |
  | FR32 | Dashboard: add Pending Early Exits count + expected recovery amount to headline area or secondary metrics

     | #17               |

  |--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ------------------------------------------------|-----------|
  | FR60   | Pre-Submission Checkpoint: Before CSV upload or manual submission, system displays staff requiring attention (approaching retirement 
  within 12 months, zero deduction last month with no event, mid-cycle events awaiting confirmation) and requires MDA officer to confirm review

  Section 8: Non-Functional Requirements (lines 800-866)

  - Current State: 39 NFRs across 5 categories. Security section previously hardened in first edit.
  - Changes Needed:
    - Performance: add cross-validation engine processing target (reconciliation of mid-cycle events against monthly CSV < 5 seconds per
  submission)
    - Performance: add historical data upload processing target (matching specs of migration tool)
    - Scalability: note historical data upload may temporarily increase ledger size significantly — system must handle bulk historical imports    
  within performance targets
  - Priority: Medium
  - Edit Items: #5, #9

  Change Plan Summary

  Changes by Type:
  - Additions: ~16 new FRs (FR60-FR75), new success metrics, new risk items
  - Updates: 7 existing FRs modified (FR10, FR16, FR17, FR20, FR25, FR32, FR33), 4 journeys updated, scope section revised
  - Removals: 0 (no content removed)
  - Restructuring: Phase 2 → MVP reclassification for employment event tracking

  Priority Distribution:
  - Critical: 9 changes (FR modifications, new FRs, scope, journeys)
  - High: 6 changes (success criteria, dashboard, early exit)
  - Medium: 5 changes (executive summary, domain reqs, NFRs)
  - Low: 1 change (domain-specific integration note)

  Estimated Effort: Substantial — but systematic. The changes are coherent and non-contradictory. Each section edit flows logically.

  Recommended Edit Order:
  1. Functional Requirements (new FRs + modifications) — foundation
  2. Product Scope (MVP features, build sequence, phase reclassification)

❯ we have infused the PRD with our changes so we need to infuse this changes in the Architecture, UX, and Epics and Stories, Sprint Planning.     
   Thoughts (make it better)

  already exist.

                                                                                                                                                  ● All four downstream artifacts exist. Let me quickly assess their current state against the PRD delta.                                           
                                                                                                                                                  ● Read 4 files (ctrl+o to expand)                                                                                                                   
● Good — now I have the full picture. Here's my strategic assessment:

  Artifact: Architecture
  Dated: 2026-02-14
  State vs PRD: References "59 FRs across 9 categories" — now 75 FRs. Missing: temporal profile data model, 8-field conditional CSV pipeline,     
  early
    exit state machine, user management subsystem, Staff ID governance, pre-submission checkpoint, cross-validation engine, data quality dashboard
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Artifact: UX Spec
  Dated: 2026-02-14
  State vs PRD: Still says "6 fields" for MDA submission. Missing: pre-submission checkpoint screen, early exit workflow screens, user management 
    screens, Staff ID management screens, temporal profile display, MDA historical data upload, data quality dashboard
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Artifact: Epics
  Dated: 2026-02-14
  State vs PRD: Only covers FR1-FR59 (9 epics). FR60-FR75 have zero coverage — no epics, no stories. Existing FR descriptions use stale wording   
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Artifact: Sprint Status
  Dated: 2026-02-14
  State vs PRD: 9 epics tracked. Missing epics for all new capability areas. Sprint sequencing doesn't account for expanded scope

  The gap is structural, not cosmetic. 16 new FRs introduce 3 new subsystems (temporal profiles, user management, Staff ID governance), 2 new     
  workflows (early exit, pre-submission checkpoint), and a fundamentally changed CSV pipeline (6→8 conditional fields). This isn't a
  find-and-replace — it's a controlled cascade.

  ---
  Recommended Strategy: Dependency-Ordered Cascade

  The naive approach — update all four in parallel — breaks because architecture constrains UX (data models dictate what screens can show), and   
  both constrain stories (you can't decompose what isn't designed). Sprint planning is meaningless until epics exist.

  The better approach:

  Phase A:  Architecture  ──────────────────────►  (foundation)
  Phase B:  UX Spec  ───────────────────────────►  (depends on A for data models + APIs)
  Phase C:  Epics & Stories  ───────────────────►  (depends on A + B for decomposition)
  Phase D:  Sprint Re-Planning  ────────────────►  (depends on C for scope)
  Phase E:  Implementation Readiness Report  ───►  (depends on all above)

  Why this order:

  1. Architecture first — The new FRs introduce data model changes (temporal fields on loan master, employment event type enum, Staff ID
  uniqueness constraints), new state machine transitions (early exit: Active → Early Exit Requested → Early Exit Approved → Settlement Computed → 
  Completed), new API surfaces (user CRUD, Staff ID search/merge/governance), and a restructured CSV validation pipeline (conditional field       
  logic). Every downstream artifact needs these decisions locked.
  2. UX second — Needs architecture's data model to know what fields to display, what state transitions to visualise, what API responses to design
   screens around. But UX also feeds back into stories — screen complexity drives frontend story granularity.
  3. Epics third — Needs both architecture (backend decomposition) and UX (frontend decomposition) to produce implementable stories. We'll add new
   epics for the new subsystems and update existing story descriptions where FRs were hardened.
  4. Sprint re-planning fourth — Can't sequence what doesn't exist yet.
  5. Implementation readiness report last — The existing one (2026-02-14) becomes the baseline for a delta assessment.

  The "Make It Better" Additions

  Three things that turn a mechanical cascade into a high-quality one:

  1. Delta merge, not regeneration. Each artifact has solid existing coverage for FR1-FR59. We surgically add the new material and update stale   
  references rather than regenerating from scratch. This preserves the design decisions already made and avoids introducing regressions.

  2. Traceability thread at each phase. As we update each artifact, we maintain the chain: FR → Architecture component → UX screen → Epic/Story.  
  When we finish Phase C, every FR60-FR75 should be traceable from PRD through to a story.

  3. Validation checkpoint after Architecture + UX. Before decomposing into stories, we do a quick consistency check — does every new FR have an  
  architecture home and a UX surface? This catches gaps early rather than discovering them during sprint execution.

❯ we have infused the PRD with our changes so we need to infuse this changes in the Architecture, UX, and Epics and Stories, Sprint Planning.     
   Thoughts (make it better)

  already exist.

                                                                                                                                                  ● Read 4 files (ctrl+o to expand)

  Artifact: Architecture
  Dated: 2026-02-14
  State vs PRD: References "59 FRs across 9 categories" — now 75 FRs. Missing: temporal profile data model, 8-field conditional CSV pipeline,     
  early
    exit state machine, user management subsystem, Staff ID governance, pre-submission checkpoint, cross-validation engine, data quality dashboard
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Artifact: UX Spec

  State vs PRD: Still says "6 fields" for MDA submission. Missing: pre-submission checkpoint screen, early exit workflow screens, user management 
    screens, Staff ID management screens, temporal profile display, MDA historical data upload, data quality dashboard
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Artifact: Epics
  Dated: 2026-02-14
  State vs PRD: Only covers FR1-FR59 (9 epics). FR60-FR75 have zero coverage — no epics, no stories. Existing FR descriptions use stale wording   
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Artifact: Sprint Status
  Dated: 2026-02-14
  State vs PRD: 9 epics tracked. Missing epics for all new capability areas. Sprint sequencing doesn't account for expanded scope

  The gap is structural, not cosmetic. 16 new FRs introduce 3 new subsystems (temporal profiles, user management, Staff ID governance), 2 new     
  workflows (early exit, pre-submission checkpoint), and a fundamentally changed CSV pipeline (6→8 conditional fields). This isn't a
  find-and-replace — it's a controlled cascade.

  ---
  Recommended Strategy: Dependency-Ordered Cascade

  The naive approach — update all four in parallel — breaks because architecture constrains UX (data models dictate what screens can show), and   
  both constrain stories (you can't decompose what isn't designed). Sprint planning is meaningless until epics exist.

  The better approach:

  Phase A:  Architecture  ──────────────────────►  (foundation)
  Phase B:  UX Spec  ───────────────────────────►  (depends on A for data models + APIs)
  Phase C:  Epics & Stories  ───────────────────►  (depends on A + B for decomposition)
  Phase D:  Sprint Re-Planning  ────────────────►  (depends on C for scope)
  Phase E:  Implementation Readiness Report  ───►  (depends on all above)

  Why this order:

  1. Architecture first — The new FRs introduce data model changes (temporal fields on loan master, employment event type enum, Staff ID
  uniqueness constraints), new state machine transitions (early exit: Active → Early Exit Requested → Early Exit Approved → Settlement Computed → 
  Completed), new API surfaces (user CRUD, Staff ID search/merge/governance), and a restructured CSV validation pipeline (conditional field       
  logic). Every downstream artifact needs these decisions locked.
  2. UX second — Needs architecture's data model to know what fields to display, what state transitions to visualise, what API responses to design
   screens around. But UX also feeds back into stories — screen complexity drives frontend story granularity.
  3. Epics third — Needs both architecture (backend decomposition) and UX (frontend decomposition) to produce implementable stories. We'll add new
   epics for the new subsystems and update existing story descriptions where FRs were hardened.
  4. Sprint re-planning fourth — Can't sequence what doesn't exist yet.
  5. Implementation readiness report last — The existing one (2026-02-14) becomes the baseline for a delta assessment.

  The "Make It Better" Additions

  Three things that turn a mechanical cascade into a high-quality one:

  1. Delta merge, not regeneration. Each artifact has solid existing coverage for FR1-FR59. We surgically add the new material and update stale   
  references rather than regenerating from scratch. This preserves the design decisions already made and avoids introducing regressions.

  2. Traceability thread at each phase. As we update each artifact, we maintain the chain: FR → Architecture component → UX screen → Epic/Story.  
  When we finish Phase C, every FR60-FR75 should be traceable from PRD through to a story.

  3. Validation checkpoint after Architecture + UX. Before decomposing into stories, we do a quick consistency check — does every new FR have an  
  architecture home and a UX surface? This catches gaps early rather than discovering them during sprint execution.
