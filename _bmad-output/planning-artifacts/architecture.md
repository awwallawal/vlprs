## Project Context Analysis

### Requirements Overview

**Functional Requirements (90 FRs across 17 categories):**

| Category | FRs | Architectural Weight |
|----------|-----|---------------------|
| Loan Computation & Financial Engine | FR1-FR9 | **Critical** — deterministic, 100% accuracy, banking-grade, 4 tiers parameterised. Standard rate: 13.33% per annum, flat-rate, universal |

**Non-Functional Requirements Driving Architecture:**

| NFR | Target | Architectural Impact |
|-----|--------|---------------------|
| Dashboard load (4G) | <3s LCP | Code splitting, API response <1KB for hero metrics |
| CSV processing (100 rows) | <10s | Server-side validation, atomic transactions |
| Search by staff ID | <2s | Database indexing strategy, query optimisation |
| System availability | 99.5% business hours | Hosting strategy, backup/restore procedures |

| Accessibility | WCAG 2.1 AA | Semantic HTML, ARIA, keyboard navigation |

**UX-Driven Architectural Requirements:**

- SPA with two zones: Public (unauthenticated) + Protected (role-based dashboard)
- Design system: shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS + Radix UI
- 11 custom components designed with full specs
- Performance budgets: FCP <1.5s, LCP <3s, TTI <3.5s, dashboard route <150KB gzipped
- Responsive breakpoints: Mobile (<768px), Tablet (768-1024px), Desktop (>1024px)
- PWA basic installability (manifest + service worker)
- PDF generation: branded reports with Oyo State crest

### Scale & Complexity

- **Primary domain:** Full-stack web (govtech-fintech)
- **Complexity level:** High
- **Data complexity:** Medium-high — relational with immutable append-only financial records, computed views, multi-tenant-like MDA isolation
- **User interaction complexity:** Medium-high — dashboard drill-down, CSV upload (8-field conditional), comparison views, exception queues, early exit workflow, mid-cycle event filing, pre-submission checkpoint, user account management, Staff ID governance
- **Integration complexity:** Low (MVP standalone) → Medium (Phase 2 external integrations)
- **Regulatory compliance:** High — NDPR, government financial audit requirements, segregation of duties
- **Estimated architectural components:** ~21 (auth, computation engine, ledger, submission, migration, dashboard, reports, notifications, exception management, PDF generation, file upload, search, RBAC, audit logging, public zone, temporal validation, early exit processing, mid-cycle events, pre-submission checkpoint, Staff ID governance, user account admin)

### Technical Constraints & Dependencies

1. **Solo developer** — architecture must maximise velocity without sacrificing correctness
2. **Nigerian 4G network** — dashboard performant on constrained bandwidth (<3s on 4G)
3. **Data sovereignty** — system and data accessible within Nigeria
4. **No floating point for money** — decimal/numeric types mandatory for all financial values
5. **Immutable ledger** — INSERT only, no UPDATE/DELETE on financial records (database + API enforced)
6. **Computed views** — balances derived from ledger entries, never stored as mutable state
7. **API-first** — all data access through structured endpoints for future integration readiness
8. **MVP standalone** — no external system integrations; 8-field CSV upload (with conditional event date and cessation reason fields) and manual entry only
9. **Non-punitive vocabulary** — API responses, error messages, and database enums must use approved terminology
10. **Temporal data required** — DOB and date of first appointment required for new loans, required in migration (flagged "Profile Incomplete" if missing). Retirement date computed, never manually set (except service extension override)

### Cross-Cutting Concerns Identified

1. **Audit logging** — every action, every module, append-only, tamper-resistant. Account lifecycle, Staff ID changes, early exit computations, service extensions all audit-logged
2. **RBAC enforcement** — API-level checks on every endpoint, MDA-scoped data isolation. User account admin scoped: Dept Admin manages MDA Officers, Super Admin manages all levels
3. **Financial computation accuracy** — 100% deterministic, kobo-precise, verifiable by auditors. Extends to early exit payoff computations and gratuity receivable projections
4. **Immutability guarantees** — database constraints + API middleware + no direct DB access
5. **Non-punitive vocabulary** — consistent across API responses, UI, error messages, database enums
6. **Input validation** — server-side at all system boundaries (CSV 8-field conditional logic, forms, API calls, mid-cycle events)
7. **Transaction atomicity** — all-or-nothing for submissions, migrations, state transitions, early exit payment recording
8. **Temporal validation** — retirement date computation (min of DOB+60y, appointment+35y), tenure vs remaining service checks, post-retirement deduction detection. Recomputed on date corrections
9. **Staff ID uniqueness** — system-wide duplicate detection on every Staff ID add/update, with justification logging for intentional overrides

## Starter Template Evaluation

### Primary Technology Domain

**Full-stack web (govtech-fintech)** — PERN stack with separate React SPA frontend + Express REST API backend, both TypeScript, in a pnpm monorepo.

### Starter Options Considered

| Option | Description | Verdict |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **A: Monorepo (pnpm workspaces)** — Custom scaffold from official Vite + Express starters | Shared TypeScript types, single repo, full control over structure | **Selected** |
| **B: Two separate repos** (frontend + backend) | Simpler initial setup but types diverge between frontend/backend — risky for financial API contracts | Rejected — type drift unacceptable for kobo-precision system |
| **C: Pre-built PERN boilerplates** (GeekyAnts, etc.) | Outdated dependencies, no shadcn/ui, no Drizzle, no immutable ledger patterns | Rejected — more rework than starting fresh |

### Selected Starter: Monorepo with pnpm Workspaces

**Rationale for Selection:**

1. **Shared TypeScript types** — API request/response types, financial enums (loan tiers, variance categories, non-punitive vocabulary), and database entity types shared between frontend and backend in a `packages/shared` workspace. Critical for a financial system where a kobo mismatch between frontend display and backend computation is unacceptable.
2. **Solo developer velocity** — Single repo, single `pnpm install`, shared linting/formatting config. No context-switching between repos.
3. **Full control** — No opinionated boilerplate to fight against. Every architectural decision (immutable ledger, RBAC middleware, audit logging) implemented deliberately.

**Initialization Command:**

```bash
# 1. Create monorepo root
mkdir vlprs && cd vlprs
pnpm init

# 2. Create workspace config (pnpm-workspace.yaml)
# packages:
#   - "apps/*"
#   - "packages/*"

# 3. Scaffold frontend (React 18 — pinned, not React 19)
npm create vite@latest apps/client -- --template react-ts
# Then pin React 18 in apps/client/package.json:
#   "react": "^18.3.1", "react-dom": "^18.3.1"

# 4. Add shadcn/ui to frontend
cd apps/client && npx shadcn@latest init && cd ../..

# 5. Create backend workspace
mkdir -p apps/server && cd apps/server && pnpm init && cd ../..

# 6. Create shared types workspace
mkdir -p packages/shared && cd packages/shared && pnpm init && cd ../..

# 7. Install all dependencies
pnpm install
```

### Architectural Decisions Established by Starter

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **Language & Runtime** | TypeScript 5.x + Node.js | Full-stack type safety, solo dev velocity |
| **Frontend Framework** | React 18.3.x + Vite 6 | Stable (React 19 has known bugs), fast HMR, SPA architecture |
| **UI System** | shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS v4 + Radix UI | Specified in UX Design Specification, Oyo Crimson palette |
| **Backend Framework** | Express 5.1.x | Stable LTS, mature middleware ecosystem for RBAC/audit/validation |
| **ORM** | Drizzle ORM | SQL-transparent, NUMERIC→string (no float for money), no codegen step, lightweight |
| **Authentication** | Plain JWT (`jsonwebtoken` + `bcrypt`) + custom RBAC middleware | Full control, no abstraction overhead, audit-transparent — every line of auth logic visible for government security review |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL 16.x | NUMERIC precision, ACID transactions, immutable ledger constraints via triggers/rules |
| **Primary Keys** | UUIDv7 | Time-sortable (natural chronological ordering for ledger entries), better index performance than UUIDv4, no sequential ID leakage |
| **Email** | Resend | Developer-friendly transactional email API, TypeScript SDK |
| **Bot Protection** | Google reCAPTCHA | Public zone protection (EOI form, login), prevents automated abuse |
| **Rate Limiting** | express-rate-limit | API endpoint protection, brute-force prevention on auth endpoints |
| **Containerisation** | Docker + Docker Compose | Dev/prod parity, consistent environments, atomic deployments |
| **Hosting** | DigitalOcean | Data sovereignty (Lagos/closest region), Droplet with Docker, managed PostgreSQL available |
| **Package Manager** | pnpm | Fast installs, strict dependency resolution, workspace support |
| **Testing** | Vitest + Playwright | Vitest: unit/integration tests (Vite-native, fast, TypeScript-first). Playwright: E2E smoke tests (login as each role → verify correct home screen, wiring validation after mock→API transitions). Three-layer quality: Unit/Integration → E2E → Structured UAT |
| **Code Organization** | Monorepo — `apps/client`, `apps/server`, `packages/shared` | Shared types, single repo |
| **Build Tooling** | Vite (frontend), tsx/tsup (backend) | Fast builds, TypeScript compilation |

### Key Technical Notes

- **React 18 (not 19)** — Pinned to React 18.3.x due to known bugs in React 19. Will upgrade when stable.
- **UUIDv7** — All primary keys use UUIDv7 for time-sortable ordering. Critical for immutable ledger entries where chronological sequence matters. Generated server-side.
- **Drizzle NUMERIC→string** — PostgreSQL `NUMERIC(15,2)` values returned as strings by Drizzle, avoiding JavaScript floating-point errors. All financial arithmetic performed server-side using string-based decimal libraries.
- **Plain JWT auth** — `jsonwebtoken` for signing/verifying, `bcrypt` for password hashing. Access token (short-lived) + refresh token (httpOnly cookie). Custom RBAC middleware — no third-party auth abstraction. Full audit transparency.
- **Rate limiting** — Tiered: stricter on auth endpoints (login, token refresh), moderate on submission endpoints, relaxed on read-only dashboard endpoints.
- **Google reCAPTCHA** — Applied to public zone forms (EOI submission, login) to prevent bot abuse. Server-side verification.
- **Resend** — Transactional emails for: submission confirmations, exception alerts, password resets, scheduled reminders (FR49-FR52).
- **DigitalOcean** — Closest region to Nigeria for data sovereignty. Options: Droplet (full control) or App Platform (managed). Managed PostgreSQL for automated backups (zero data loss tolerance).

**Note:** Project initialisation using this structure should be the first implementation story.

## Core Architectural Decisions

### Decision Priority Analysis

**Critical Decisions (Block Implementation):**
- Data architecture: immutable ledger schema, financial precision strategy, validation pipeline
- Authentication: JWT token lifecycle, RBAC middleware chain, refresh token security
- API design: REST resource conventions, error response format, non-punitive vocabulary enforcement
- Deployment: CI/CD auto-deploy pipeline, zero-downtime strategy

**Important Decisions (Shape Architecture):**
- Frontend state management, routing, code splitting
- Logging and monitoring strategy
- PDF generation approach
- Backup and disaster recovery

**Deferred Decisions (Post-MVP):**
- Redis caching layer (if PostgreSQL query performance degrades at scale)
- SMS notification provider (fast-follow feature)
- API versioning (only if breaking changes needed post-launch)
- CDN for static assets (premature at current scale)

### Data Architecture

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **Schema management** | Drizzle Kit — schema-first with `drizzle-kit generate` for migrations | Define schema in TypeScript. `drizzle-kit push` for rapid local iteration, `drizzle-kit generate` + `drizzle-kit migrate` for production. Migrations committed to git for auditability |
| **Validation pipeline** | Zod schemas in `packages/shared`, used by both client and server | Single source of truth. Same schema validates CSV upload rows on server AND form inputs on client. `drizzle-zod` auto-generates base schemas from DB schema, extended with business rules |
| **Financial arithmetic** | Server-side only, `decimal.js` library for all Naira/Kobo calculations | Never compute money on client. All financial logic in `apps/server/src/services/computation-engine.ts`. `decimal.js` handles arbitrary-precision arithmetic. Frontend receives pre-formatted display strings |
| **Caching** | No cache layer for MVP — PostgreSQL query optimisation only | 3,100 beneficiaries / ~189K ledger rows over 5 years is well within PostgreSQL capacity. Indexed queries, partial indexes on active loans, materialised views for dashboard aggregates if needed. Redis deferred |
| **Immutable ledger enforcement** | 3-layer defence: DB trigger + Drizzle middleware + Express middleware | **Layer 1 (DB):** PostgreSQL `BEFORE UPDATE OR DELETE` trigger on `ledger_entries` raises exception. **Layer 2 (ORM):** Drizzle query wrapper rejects `.update()` / `.delete()` on ledger tables. **Layer 3 (API):** Express middleware rejects `PUT`/`PATCH`/`DELETE` on `/api/ledger/*` routes. Any single layer failing still leaves two protections |
| **Soft deletes** | Mutable tables (users, MDAs) use `deleted_at` timestamp, never hard delete | Preserves referential integrity and audit trail. Ledger entries are never deleted (not even soft) |
| **UUIDv7 generation** | Server-side via `uuidv7` npm package, stored as PostgreSQL `uuid` type | Generated in service layer before DB insert. Time-sortable component provides natural chronological ordering for ledger entries without relying on auto-increment |

### Authentication & Security

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **Auth implementation** | Plain JWT — `jsonwebtoken` for sign/verify, `bcrypt` (12 rounds) for password hashing | No third-party auth framework. Every line of auth logic is visible, auditable, and under full control. Government auditors can inspect the entire auth flow without navigating library internals |
| **Token lifecycle** | Access token (15min, in-memory) + Refresh token (7 days, httpOnly secure cookie) | Access token stored in React state (not localStorage — XSS-safe). Refresh token in `httpOnly`, `secure`, `sameSite: strict` cookie — immune to JavaScript access. On 401, client hits `/api/auth/refresh` to get new access token silently |
| **Refresh token storage** | PostgreSQL `refresh_tokens` table with: `token_hash`, `user_id`, `expires_at`, `created_at`, `revoked_at` | Enables: token rotation (revoke old on refresh), forced logout (revoke all tokens for user), audit trail of all sessions. Hashed with SHA-256 — raw token never stored |
| **Token rotation** | On every refresh, old token is revoked + new token issued | If a refresh token is reused after rotation, ALL tokens for that user are revoked (reuse detection = potential theft). User must re-login |
| **RBAC middleware** | Custom Express middleware checking JWT claims: `{ role, mdaId, userId }` | 3 roles: `super_admin` (all MDAs), `dept_admin` (Car Loan Dept), `mda_officer` (own MDA only). Middleware chain: `authenticate` → `authorise(requiredRoles)` → `scopeToMda` → route handler |
| **MDA data isolation** | Every query automatically scoped by `mda_id` from JWT for `mda_officer` role | `mda_officer` can never access another MDA's data — enforced at query level, not just route level. `super_admin` and `dept_admin` bypass MDA scoping |
| **Password policy** | Minimum 8 chars, at least 1 uppercase, 1 number. Validated by Zod schema | Government users, not public internet — pragmatic security without frustrating non-technical MDA officers |
| **Data encryption at rest** | PostgreSQL `pgcrypto` for PII fields (staff names, employee IDs) + AES-256 | Encrypt sensitive columns at application layer before insert. Decryption keys in environment variables, never in code. NDPR compliance |
| **API security middleware stack** | `helmet` → `cors` → `express-rate-limit` → `authenticate` → `authorise` → `auditLog` → route handler | Each concern separated. Helmet sets security headers. CORS restricts origins to frontend domain. Rate limit applied before auth to prevent brute-force. Audit log captures authenticated user + action |
| **Google reCAPTCHA** | reCAPTCHA v3 (invisible, score-based) on public forms + login | No user friction — runs invisibly, returns risk score. Server-side verification via Google API. Applied to: login, password reset, public EOI form |
| **CSRF protection** | `csurf` or double-submit cookie pattern | Since refresh tokens use httpOnly cookies, CSRF protection is mandatory. CSRF token sent in response header, client includes in `X-CSRF-Token` request header |

### API & Communication Patterns

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **API style** | REST, resource-based, flat URL structure, no versioning for MVP | `/api/auth/*`, `/api/loans/*`, `/api/submissions/*`, `/api/ledger/*`, `/api/dashboard/*`, `/api/exceptions/*`, `/api/reports/*`, `/api/employment-events/*`, `/api/early-exits/*`, `/api/pre-submission/*`, `/api/staff-id/*`, `/api/users/*`, `/api/migrations/*`. Versioning deferred — add `/v2/` only if breaking changes post-launch |
| **Request/Response format** | JSON only, `Content-Type: application/json` except file uploads (`multipart/form-data`) | CSV uploads use multipart. All other endpoints JSON. Response envelope: `{ success: boolean, data?: T, error?: { code: string, message: string, details?: unknown } }` |
| **Non-punitive vocabulary** | Enforced in error codes and messages via shared constants | Error codes use approved terms: `VARIANCE_DETECTED` not `ERROR_FOUND`, `REVIEW_REQUIRED` not `VIOLATION`. Constants defined in `packages/shared/src/constants/vocabulary.ts` |
| **API documentation** | Swagger/OpenAPI via `swagger-jsdoc` + `swagger-ui-express` | Auto-generated from JSDoc annotations on route handlers. Available at `/api/docs` in development. Useful for auditors and future integrators |
| **HTTP client (frontend)** | Native `fetch` with typed wrapper in `apps/client/src/lib/api-client.ts` | Zero-dependency. Wrapper handles: JWT attachment from memory, 401 → silent refresh → retry, response typing from `packages/shared`, error normalisation |
| **Rate limiting tiers** | Strict (auth) → Moderate (mutations) → Relaxed (reads) | Auth endpoints: 5 req/15min per IP. Submission/write endpoints: 30 req/min per user. Dashboard/read endpoints: 120 req/min per user |
| **File upload** | `multer` middleware, max 5MB per CSV, server-side parsing with `papaparse` | 8-field CSV validated row-by-row against Zod schema with conditional logic (fields 7-8 required/blank based on Event Flag and Amount). Atomic: entire file succeeds or entire file rejected with per-row error report referencing field names and row numbers |

### Frontend Architecture

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **Server state** | TanStack Query v5 | Cache dashboard hero metrics, auto-refetch on window focus, stale-while-revalidate for drill-downs. Deduplicates concurrent requests. Perfect for the AG checking dashboard on phone |
| **Client state** | Zustand (minimal store) | Only for ephemeral UI state: sidebar toggle, active tab, modal visibility, filter selections. All server data lives in TanStack Query cache |
| **Routing** | React Router v7 with lazy routes | Two route groups: public (`/`, `/about`, `/scheme/*`, `/how-it-works`, `/resources/*`, `/support`, `/privacy`, `/disclaimer`, `/accessibility`, `/eoi`, `/login`) and protected (`/dashboard/*`). Public pages share a `PublicLayout` (nav + footer) and are built from 4 page templates: Content Page (8+4 col with sidebar), Card Grid (responsive cards), Placeholder (Coming Soon), Homepage (unique). 8 shared public components in `components/public/`. See wireframes-epic-14.md for full wireframes and component mapping. Each dashboard sub-route lazy-loaded via `React.lazy()` + `Suspense`. Auth guard at `/dashboard` layout level |
| **Forms** | React Hook Form + `@hookform/resolvers/zod` | Zod schemas from `packages/shared` power both client-side validation and server-side validation. Single source of truth for: CSV column mapping form, exception annotation form, loan parameter form |
| **Code splitting** | Vite dynamic imports + React.lazy per major route | Dashboard, submissions, exceptions, reports, admin — each a separate chunk. Target: dashboard route <150KB gzipped per UX performance budget |
| **PDF generation** | Server-side via `@react-pdf/renderer` | Branded PDFs with Oyo State crest rendered on server. Client requests PDF → server generates → returns as `application/pdf` download. No client-side PDF libraries in bundle |
| **Date handling** | `date-fns` (tree-shakeable) | Lightweight, functional, TypeScript-first. Only import needed functions. Used for: loan tenure calculations, submission period formatting, retirement date projections |
| **Charts** | `recharts` (built on D3, React-native) | Dashboard visualisations: fund pool trends, MDA comparison bars, deduction timeline. Responsive, SSR-safe, shadcn-compatible styling |

### Infrastructure & Deployment

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **Containerisation** | Docker + Docker Compose | Dev/prod parity guaranteed. `docker-compose.dev.yml` for local development (PostgreSQL + server + client hot-reload). `docker-compose.prod.yml` for production. Eliminates "works on my machine" issues |
| **DigitalOcean setup** | Ubuntu Droplet + Managed PostgreSQL | Full control over Docker runtime. Managed DB handles automated daily backups + point-in-time recovery (zero data loss). More cost-effective than App Platform for long-running containers |
| **CI/CD** | GitHub Actions — auto-deploy on push to `main` | **Pipeline:** `push to main` → lint → typecheck → test → build Docker images → push to GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io) → SSH to Droplet → `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`. **Branch strategy:** `main` (production, protected), `dev` (development). Merge `dev` → `main` via PR triggers deploy |
| **Deploy mechanism** | Docker-based: GitHub Actions builds images → pushes to ghcr.io → Droplet pulls + restarts | Atomic deployments — new container starts, health check passes, old container stops. Rollback = `docker compose up -d` with previous image tag |
| **Branch protection** | `main` branch: require PR, require CI pass, no direct push | Prevents accidental broken deploys. `dev` branch: direct push allowed for solo dev velocity |
| **Process management** | Docker restart policy (`unless-stopped`) + health checks | Docker handles auto-restart on crash. No PM2 needed — Docker is the process manager. Health check endpoint `/api/health` polled by Docker to detect unhealthy containers |
| **Reverse proxy** | Nginx (containerised) | Runs as Docker service. Serves React static build. Proxies `/api/*` to Express container. SSL via Let's Encrypt + Certbot auto-renewal. Gzip compression. Security headers |
| **Environment config** | `.env` files per environment, Docker Compose `env_file` directive | `.env.development`, `.env.production`, `.env.example` (committed as template). Secrets (JWT_SECRET, DB password, Resend API key, reCAPTCHA secret) never committed. GitHub Actions secrets for CI/CD. Production `.env` lives on Droplet only |
| **Logging** | `pino` (structured JSON logs) → Docker log driver | Fast, low-overhead, structured. Every log entry includes: `timestamp`, `level`, `userId`, `mdaId`, `action`, `resource`, `ip`. Docker captures stdout/stderr. `docker logs` for access. Searchable with `pino-pretty` in development |
| **Audit logging** | Dedicated `audit_log` table (append-only, UUIDv7 PK) | Every authenticated API call logged: `user_id`, `role`, `mda_id`, `action`, `resource`, `request_body_hash`, `response_status`, `ip`, `timestamp`. INSERT only — same immutability pattern as ledger. Used by auditors, not displayed in app |
| **Monitoring** | DigitalOcean built-in monitoring + UptimeRobot (free tier) | DO alerts on: CPU >80%, memory >85%, disk >90%. UptimeRobot pings `/api/health` every 5 min for 99.5% availability SLA tracking. Email alerts on downtime |
| **Backup strategy** | Managed PostgreSQL daily auto-backups + weekly `pg_dump` to DigitalOcean Spaces | **Layer 1:** Managed DB automated daily backups with 7-day retention + point-in-time recovery. **Layer 2:** Weekly `pg_dump` via cron → compressed → uploaded to DO Spaces (object storage). Belt and suspenders for zero data loss tolerance |
| **SSL/TLS** | Let's Encrypt via Certbot, auto-renewal via cron | Free, trusted certificates. Auto-renewal ensures no expiry downtime. HTTPS enforced — HTTP redirects to HTTPS |
| **Domain** | Custom domain pointing to Droplet IP via A record | `vlprs.oyostate.gov.ng` (or similar). DNS managed at registrar level |

### Decision Impact Analysis

**Implementation Sequence (critical path):**

1. **Monorepo scaffold** — pnpm workspace, shared tsconfig, ESLint/Prettier
2. **Database schema** — Drizzle schema with immutability triggers, UUIDv7 PKs
3. **Auth system** — JWT sign/verify, bcrypt, refresh token table, RBAC middleware
4. **API skeleton** — Express 5 with middleware chain (helmet → cors → rate-limit → auth → audit)
5. **CI/CD pipeline** — GitHub Actions auto-deploy on merge to `main`. Deployed before frontend so every subsequent commit auto-deploys to client domain
6. **Public website & scheme information** — Static public zone pages (homepage with hero/Programme Notice/loan tiers/CTA, scheme information pages, resources, legal). Responsive navigation with login modal, 4-column footer. No backend API dependencies — purely client-side content pages within the SPA. First public impression for AG, IT Assessors, and stakeholders
7. **Frontend shell + screen scaffolding** — Vite + React 18 + shadcn/ui + React Router, auth flow, design system (Oyo Crimson tokens, Inter/JetBrains Mono typography, extended Badge variants), role-specific skeleton screens (Executive Dashboard, MDA Submission, Operations Hub, MDA Detail, Loan Detail) with mock data layer, demo seed script (5 accounts, 63 MDAs, mock loans). All data access through hook abstractions returning mock data from `src/mocks/` — each hook switchable to real API with zero UI component changes
8. **Computation engine** — `decimal.js` financial calculations, ledger INSERT logic. Wire `useLoanDetail` and `useLoanSearch` hooks to real endpoints
9. **Dashboard wiring** — Replace mock data in `useDashboardMetrics`, `useMdaComplianceGrid`, `useAttentionItems` hooks with TanStack Query calls to real dashboard API endpoints
10. **Submission workflow** — CSV upload → validate → atomic ledger insert → comparison engine. Wire `useSubmissionHistory` hook to real endpoints
11. **Remaining features** — exceptions, reports, PDF, notifications, migration tool. Each feature wires its corresponding mock hooks to real APIs

**Cross-Component Dependencies:**

- **Auth ↔ Every route** — All protected endpoints depend on JWT middleware + RBAC
- **Shared types ↔ Client + Server** — API contracts, Zod schemas, enums consumed by both workspaces
- **Mock data layer ↔ Real APIs** — All frontend screens use hook abstractions (e.g., `useDashboardMetrics()`) that return mock data from Sprint 1. As backend endpoints are delivered, hooks are updated to call real APIs — zero UI component changes required. Wiring map documents each hook→endpoint→sprint mapping
- **Computation engine ↔ Ledger** — Financial calculations write to immutable ledger; dashboard reads computed views from ledger
- **Audit log ↔ Every mutation** — Middleware captures authenticated user + action for every write operation
- **Non-punitive vocabulary ↔ Every response** — Shared constants enforce approved terminology across error messages, API responses, and UI copy
- **Docker ↔ All services** — Consistent runtime environment from local dev to production. Docker Compose orchestrates service dependencies

## Implementation Patterns & Consistency Rules

### Pattern Categories Defined

**27 critical conflict points** identified across 5 categories where AI agents could make different implementation choices. Each resolved below with binding conventions.

### Naming Patterns

**Database Naming (PostgreSQL/Drizzle):**

| Element | Convention | Example | Anti-Pattern |
|---------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Tables | `snake_case`, **plural** | `ledger_entries`, `refresh_tokens`, `mda_submissions` | `LedgerEntry`, `ledgerEntries` |
| Columns | `snake_case` | `staff_id`, `created_at`, `loan_amount` | `staffId`, `CreatedAt` |
| Primary keys | `id` (UUIDv7) | `id uuid PRIMARY KEY` | `ledger_entry_id`, `pk` |
| Foreign keys | `{referenced_table_singular}_id` | `user_id`, `mda_id`, `loan_id` | `fk_user`, `userId` |
| Indexes | `idx_{table}_{columns}` | `idx_ledger_entries_staff_id` | `ledger_staff_index` |
| Enums | `snake_case` type, `SCREAMING_SNAKE` values | `loan_status` type with `ACTIVE`, `COMPLETED`, `WRITTEN_OFF` | `LoanStatus`, `active` |
| Timestamps | `created_at`, `updated_at`, `deleted_at` | Always `timestamptz`, never `timestamp` | `createdDate`, `date_created` |
| Boolean columns | `is_` or `has_` prefix | `is_active`, `has_retired` | `active`, `retired` |
| Money columns | `_amount` suffix, `NUMERIC(15,2)` | `loan_amount`, `deduction_amount` | `amount` (ambiguous), `FLOAT` |

**API Naming:**

| Element | Convention | Example | Anti-Pattern |
|---------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Endpoints | `/api/{resource}`, **plural**, lowercase | `/api/loans`, `/api/submissions` | `/api/Loan`, `/api/getLoan` |
| Nested resources | `/api/{parent}/{id}/{child}` | `/api/mdas/:mdaId/submissions` | `/api/mda-submissions` |
| Actions (non-CRUD) | `/api/{resource}/{id}/{verb}` | `/api/submissions/:id/approve` | `/api/approveSubmission` |
| Query params | `camelCase` | `?staffId=xxx&page=1&sortBy=createdAt` | `?staff_id=xxx` |
| Route params | `camelCase` | `:loanId`, `:mdaId` | `:loan_id` |
| JSON request/response fields | `camelCase` | `{ loanAmount, staffId, createdAt }` | `{ loan_amount }` |

**Note:** Database is `snake_case`, JSON/API is `camelCase`. Drizzle handles the mapping automatically via column aliases.

**Code Naming:**

| Element | Convention | Example | Anti-Pattern |
|---------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Files (components) | `PascalCase.tsx` | `HeroMetricCard.tsx`, `LoanTable.tsx` | `hero-metric-card.tsx` |
| Files (utilities/hooks) | `camelCase.ts` | `useAuth.ts`, `apiClient.ts` | `use-auth.ts` |
| Files (routes/middleware) | `camelCase.ts` | `loanRoutes.ts`, `authMiddleware.ts` | `loan-routes.ts` |
| Files (Drizzle schema) | `camelCase.ts` | `schema.ts`, `loanSchema.ts` | `loan-schema.ts` |
| React components | `PascalCase` | `HeroMetricCard`, `SubmissionTable` | `heroMetricCard` |
| Functions | `camelCase`, verb-first | `getLoanById()`, `computeBalance()` | `loanGet()`, `balance()` |
| Variables | `camelCase` | `loanAmount`, `staffId` | `loan_amount` |
| Constants | `SCREAMING_SNAKE` | `MAX_CSV_ROWS`, `JWT_EXPIRY` | `maxCsvRows` |
| Types/Interfaces | `PascalCase`, no `I` prefix | `Loan`, `Submission`, `ApiResponse<T>` | `ILoan`, `LoanInterface` |
| Enums (TS) | `PascalCase` name, `PascalCase` values | `LoanStatus.Active`, `VarianceType.OverDeduction` | `LOAN_STATUS.ACTIVE` |
| Zod schemas | `camelCase` + `Schema` suffix | `loanSchema`, `submissionRowSchema` | `LoanSchema`, `loanValidator` |
| Environment variables | `SCREAMING_SNAKE` | `JWT_SECRET`, `DATABASE_URL`, `RESEND_API_KEY` | `jwtSecret` |

```

### Format Patterns

**API Response Envelope:**

```typescript
// Success response
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { ... }
}

// Success with pagination
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [ ... ],
  "pagination": {
    "page": 1,
    "pageSize": 20,
    "totalItems": 342,
    "totalPages": 18
  }
}

// Error response
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "VARIANCE_DETECTED",
    "message": "A variance was detected in the submission",
    "details": [ ... ]
  }
}
```

**HTTP Status Code Usage:**

| Status | When |
|--------|------|
| `200` | Successful GET, PUT, PATCH |
| `201` | Successful POST (resource created) |
| `204` | Successful DELETE (no content) |
| `400` | Validation failure (Zod), malformed request |
| `401` | Missing/expired/invalid JWT |
| `403` | Valid JWT but insufficient role or MDA scope |
| `404` | Resource not found |
| `409` | Conflict (duplicate submission for same period) |
| `422` | Business logic rejection (e.g., CSV rows fail validation) |
| `429` | Rate limit exceeded |
| `500` | Unhandled server error (never expose internals) |

**Date/Time Format:**

- Database: `timestamptz` (UTC)
- JSON/API: ISO 8601 strings — `"2026-02-14T10:30:00.000Z"`
- Frontend display: Formatted via `date-fns` — `"14 Feb 2026"`, `"February 2026"`
- Submission periods: `"YYYY-MM"` format — `"2026-02"` for February 2026

**Money Format:**

- Database: `NUMERIC(15,2)` stored as precise decimal
- API JSON: String — `"278602.72"` (never number, never float)
- Frontend display: `NairaDisplay` component — `"₦278,602.72"`
- Computation: `decimal.js` — never `Number`, never `parseFloat`

### Communication Patterns

**TanStack Query Key Convention:**

```typescript
queryKey: ['loans']                          // all loans
queryKey: ['loans', loanId]                  // single loan
queryKey: ['submissions', { mdaId, period }] // filtered list
queryKey: ['dashboard', 'heroMetrics']       // dashboard section (incl. early exit + gratuity receivable)
queryKey: ['dashboard', 'attentionItems']    // dashboard section
queryKey: ['employmentEvents', { staffId }]  // mid-cycle events for staff
queryKey: ['employmentEvents', { mdaId }]    // mid-cycle events for MDA
queryKey: ['earlyExits', loanId]             // early exit computations for loan
queryKey: ['preSubmission', 'checkpoint']    // pre-submission checkpoint data
queryKey: ['staffId', 'search', query]       // Staff ID search results
queryKey: ['users', { role, mdaId }]         // user accounts filtered
```

**Zustand Store Convention:**

```typescript
// One store per UI concern, minimal. NEVER put server data in Zustand.
const useUiStore = create<UiState>((set) => ({
  sidebarOpen: true,
  toggleSidebar: () => set((s) => ({ sidebarOpen: !s.sidebarOpen })),
}))
```

**Logging Levels (pino):**

| Level | Usage |
|-------|-------|
| `error` | Unhandled exceptions, failed DB transactions, auth failures |
| `warn` | Rate limit triggered, variance detected, approaching resource limits |
| `info` | API request/response, auth events, ledger mutations, submission processed |
| `debug` | Query execution, computation steps, middleware chain (dev only) |

**Structured Log Format:**

```json
{
  "level": "info",
  "time": "2026-02-14T10:30:00.000Z",
  "userId": "019...",
  "mdaId": "019...",
  "action": "SUBMISSION_CREATED",
  "resource": "/api/submissions",
  "method": "POST",
  "statusCode": 201,
  "durationMs": 342,
  "ip": "102.89.x.x"
}
```

### Process Patterns

**Error Handling — Server:**

```typescript
// Centralised error handler (last middleware in chain)
// All route handlers throw AppError — never send response directly on error
class AppError extends Error {
  constructor(
    public statusCode: number,
    public code: string,           // SCREAMING_SNAKE, non-punitive
    public message: string,        // human-readable, non-punitive
    public details?: unknown
  ) { super(message) }
}

// Usage: throw new AppError(422, 'VARIANCE_DETECTED', 'Submission contains rows requiring review', rowErrors)
// NEVER: res.status(500).json({...}) in a route handler
```

**Error Handling — Client:**

```typescript
// TanStack Query onError → shadcn Toast notification (non-punitive language)
// Global React ErrorBoundary wraps app for unhandled errors
// 401 errors → silent token refresh → retry → if still 401 → redirect to /login
```

**Loading State Pattern:**

```typescript
// TanStack Query provides: isLoading, isFetching, isError
// Initial load → shadcn Skeleton components
// Background refetch → subtle spinner overlay (data still visible underneath)
// NEVER: blank white screen during loading
// NEVER: custom isLoading boolean in Zustand
```

**Validation Pattern (3-stage):**

1. **Client-side** (React Hook Form + Zod) — instant feedback, prevents bad requests
2. **API middleware** (Zod via `validate` middleware) — rejects malformed requests before service layer
3. **Database** (constraints, triggers) — final safety net, catches anything bypassing layers 1-2

**Auth Flow Pattern:**

```
Login  → POST /api/auth/login
       → verify reCAPTCHA → validate credentials → bcrypt compare
       → generate access token (15min) + refresh token (7d)
       → store refresh token hash in DB
       → return { accessToken } in body + set httpOnly refresh cookie
       → client stores accessToken in React state (memory only)

Request → Authorization: Bearer {accessToken} header on every API call
        → authenticate middleware verifies JWT, extracts { userId, role, mdaId }
        → authorise middleware checks role permission
        → scopeToMda middleware restricts data access

Refresh → 401 from any endpoint
        → interceptor calls POST /api/auth/refresh (cookie sent automatically)
        → server verifies refresh token hash in DB, checks not revoked/expired
        → rotates: revoke old token, issue new access + refresh tokens
        → retry original request with new accessToken

Logout  → POST /api/auth/logout
        → revoke refresh token in DB → clear httpOnly cookie
        → client clears accessToken from state → redirect to /login
```

**Docker Development Workflow:**

```bash
# Start all services (PG + server + client with hot-reload)
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up

# Run migrations
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec server pnpm db:migrate

# Run tests
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec server pnpm test

# Seed development data
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec server pnpm db:seed
```

### Enforcement Guidelines

**All AI Agents MUST:**

1. Follow naming conventions exactly — no "creative alternatives"
2. Use `AppError` class for all server errors — never raw `res.status().json()` in route handlers
3. Use non-punitive vocabulary from `packages/shared/src/constants/vocabulary.ts` — no error/mistake/violation terminology
4. Put ALL financial arithmetic in `computationEngine.ts` using `decimal.js` — never compute money elsewhere
5. Use UUIDv7 via `lib/uuidv7.ts` for all new records — never auto-increment, never UUIDv4
6. Use Zod schemas from `packages/shared` — never write inline validation
7. Use TanStack Query for all server state — never fetch in `useEffect`, never store server data in Zustand
8. Import role constants from `@vlprs/shared` — never hardcode role strings (`'super_admin'`, `'dept_admin'`, `'mda_officer'`). Both apps/server and apps/client import `ROLES` from `packages/shared/src/constants/roles.ts` (single source of truth). OSLRS lesson: frontend/backend role string mismatch caused 3 roles to fail at runtime despite 53 passing tests
9. TanStack Query hook naming: individual hooks follow `use<Action><Entity>` pattern — e.g., `useCreateLoan()`, `useDeactivateMda()`, `useSearchLoans()`. Query hooks: `use<Entity>()` or `use<Entity>Detail(id)`. File-level grouping by domain (e.g., `useLoans.ts` exports `useLoans()`, `useLoanDetail()`, `useCreateLoan()`)
10. Co-locate tests with source files — never create a separate `__tests__` directory
9. Ledger table: INSERT only — never write `.update()` or `.delete()` on ledger tables
10. Money values as strings in JSON — never `number` type for financial amounts in API responses
11. Docker Compose for local development — never run services directly on host for integration testing

**Pattern Verification:**

- ESLint custom rules for naming conventions
- TypeScript strict mode catches type mismatches between shared schemas
- CI pipeline runs `pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm test` before deploy
- Docker builds must succeed in CI before image is pushed to registry
- Drizzle schema is single source of truth for DB structure — never write raw DDL

### Public Zone Page Templates

> 20 public pages share 4 layout templates. Implement templates first, then each page is content. Full wireframes with component annotations in `wireframes-epic-14.md`.

| Template | Layout | Used By | Tailwind Grid |
|----------|--------|---------|---------------|
| **Content Page** | 8-col main + 4-col sidebar (optional) + CTA banner | About the Programme, Programme Overview, About VLPRS, Eligibility, Repayment, How It Works, MDA Guide, Privacy, Disclaimer, Accessibility, Help & Support (11 pages) | `grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-12 gap-8` |
| **Card Grid** | Page header + responsive card grid | Downloads & Forms, News & Announcements (2 pages) | `grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6` |
| **Placeholder** | Centred styled "Coming Soon" card with icon, description, related links | Approved Beneficiary Lists, Expression of Interest (2 pages) | `max-w-lg mx-auto text-center py-24` |
| **Homepage** | Unique full-page layout — 13 sections, each with distinct grid | Homepage only (1 page) | Varies per section — see wireframes |

**Shared Public Components (8):** All public pages compose from `components/public/`: `PublicNavBar`, `LoginModal`, `PublicFooter`, `BreadcrumbNav`, `PageHeader`, `CtaBanner`, `DisclaimerCallout`, `ProgrammeDisclaimer`. See wireframes-epic-14.md § Shared Components for wireframes, props, and shadcn/ui mapping.

**Page template file convention:** Templates are not separate files — they are layout patterns documented in wireframes. Each page `.tsx` file composes the pattern directly using the shared components. No abstract `<ContentPageTemplate>` wrapper needed — keep it simple.

### Architectural Boundaries

**Request Flow (Client → Database):**

```
Client (React SPA)
    │
    │  HTTPS (JWT in Authorization header)
    ▼
Nginx container (reverse proxy, SSL termination, static files)
    │
    │  HTTP (internal Docker network, /api/* only)
    ▼
Express Middleware Chain
    │  helmet → cors → rateLimiter → [captcha] → authenticate → authorise → scopeToMda → validate → auditLog
    ▼
Route Handler (thin — calls service, formats response)
    │
    ▼
Service Layer (business logic, financial computations)
    │
    ▼
Drizzle ORM (query builders, schema enforcement)
    │
    ▼
PostgreSQL (constraints, triggers, immutability enforcement)
```

**Data Boundaries:**

| Boundary | Rule |
|----------|------|
| `ledger_entries` table | INSERT only. No UPDATE/DELETE at DB, ORM, or API level |
| `audit_log` table | INSERT only. Same immutability pattern as ledger |
| `refresh_tokens` table | INSERT + soft-revoke (`revoked_at`). Never DELETE |
| `observations` table | Full CRUD with soft deletes. Columns: `id` (UUIDv7), `type` (enum: rate_variance, stalled_balance, negative_balance, multi_mda, no_approval_match, consecutive_loan), `staff_name`, `staff_id`, `loan_id` (FK → loans, nullable), `mda_id` (FK → mdas NOT NULL), `migration_record_id` (FK → migration_records, nullable — links to source record, used in idempotency guard), `upload_id` (FK → migration_uploads, nullable — links to source upload batch), `description` (text NOT NULL), `context` (JSONB NOT NULL — `{ possibleExplanations: string[], suggestedAction: string, dataCompleteness: number, dataPoints: Record<string, unknown> }`), `source_reference` (JSONB nullable — `{ file: string, sheet: string, row: number }`), `status` (enum: unreviewed, reviewed, resolved, promoted — includes `promoted` for exception handoff), `data_completeness` (NUMERIC — 0-100 score), `reviewer_id` (FK → users, nullable), `reviewer_note` (text nullable), `reviewed_at` (timestamptz nullable), `resolution_note` (text nullable), `resolved_at` (timestamptz nullable), `promoted_exception_id` (uuid nullable — FK to exceptions table if promoted), `created_at`, `updated_at`, `deleted_at`. Indexes: `(type, migration_record_id)` unique for idempotency, `(type)`, `(mda_id)`, `(status)`, `(staff_name)`, `(upload_id)` |
| `person_matches` table | Append-only with status lifecycle (no soft delete — rejections are preserved as informative history). Columns: `id` (UUIDv7), `person_a_name` (text), `person_a_staff_id` (text nullable), `person_a_mda_id` (FK → mdas), `person_b_name` (text), `person_b_staff_id` (text nullable), `person_b_mda_id` (FK → mdas), `match_type` (enum: exact_name, staff_id, surname_initial, fuzzy_name, manual — 5 types reflecting SQ-1's 3-level matching + Staff ID + manual), `confidence` (NUMERIC(3,2) — 0.00 to 1.00), `status` (enum: auto_confirmed, pending_review, confirmed, rejected — default pending_review), `confirmed_by` (FK → users, nullable), `confirmed_at` (timestamptz nullable), `created_at` |
| `migration_uploads` table | Full CRUD with soft deletes. Columns: `id` (UUIDv7), `mda_id` (FK → mdas), `uploaded_by` (FK → users), `filename` (text), `file_size_bytes` (int), `sheet_count` (int), `total_records` (int), `status` (enum: uploaded, mapped, processing, completed, validated, reconciled, certified, failed), `era_detected` (int nullable), `metadata` (JSONB — stores confirmed column mapping config), `created_at`, `updated_at`, `deleted_at`. Tracks each legacy file upload session through the migration pipeline. Status progression: uploaded → mapped → processing → completed → validated (Story 3.2) → reconciled (Story 3.4) → certified (Story 3.5 final stage) |
| `migration_records` table | Full CRUD with soft deletes. Columns: `id` (UUIDv7), `upload_id` (FK → migration_uploads), `mda_id` (FK → mdas), `sheet_name`, `row_number` (int), `era` (int), `period_year` (int nullable), `period_month` (int nullable), `staff_name` (text NOT NULL), all 24 canonical financial/temporal fields as nullable columns (NUMERIC(15,2) for money, text for dates/strings, int for counts), `source_file` (text), `source_sheet` (text), `source_row` (int), `created_at`, `deleted_at`. Staging table — one row per extracted data record. Records advance through validation (Story 3.2) → baseline (Story 3.4) before becoming loan records |
| `migration_extra_fields` table | Full CRUD with soft deletes. Columns: `id` (UUIDv7), `record_id` (FK → migration_records), `field_name` (text — original header name), `field_value` (text), `source_header` (text — exact header string from file), `created_at`, `deleted_at`. Captures non-standard columns (e.g., bank name, phone number) that don't map to canonical fields — no data is discarded |
| `mdas.parent_mda_id` column | Self-referential nullable FK on `mdas` table (`uuid REFERENCES mdas(id)`). Replaces the originally proposed `mda_relationships` junction table — a simple parent/child column is sufficient since only one level of hierarchy exists (CDU under Agriculture). Established in Story 3.0b |
| All other tables | Full CRUD with soft deletes (`deleted_at`). Never hard DELETE |
| Money values | `NUMERIC(15,2)` in DB → string in API → `NairaDisplay` in UI |
| PII fields | Encrypted at rest via `pgcrypto`. Decrypted in service layer only |
| MDA data isolation | `mda_officer`: all queries scoped by `mda_id` from JWT |

**Service Boundaries (ownership + allowed calls):**

| Service | Owns | Calls | Never Calls |
|---------|------|-------|-------------|
| `computationEngine` | Financial math, balance derivation, early exit payoff calculation, gratuity receivable projection | `decimal.ts` | DB directly |
| `ledgerService` | Ledger INSERT, computed views | `computationEngine`, `db/queries/ledgerQueries` | Any UPDATE/DELETE |
| `submissionService` | 8-field CSV parsing, conditional field validation, atomic submission | `ledgerService`, `comparisonEngine`, `employmentEventService`, `emailService` | `computationEngine` directly |
| `comparisonEngine` | Variance detection | `computationEngine` (for system values) | DB writes |

### Data Flow: Monthly Submission Lifecycle

```
MDA Officer navigates to Submissions
    │
    ▼
[0] preSubmissionRoutes.ts → GET /pre-submission/checkpoint
    │  → preSubmissionService.ts assembles:
    │     • staff approaching retirement within 12 months
    │     • staff with zero deduction last month and no event filed
    │     • mid-cycle events reported since last submission awaiting CSV confirmation
    │  → MDA Officer reviews and confirms via checkbox
    ▼
[1] submissionRoutes.ts → validate(csvUploadSchema) → multer parses 8-field CSV
    │
    ▼
[2] submissionService.ts → papaparse rows → validate each with submissionRowSchema
    │  (8-field conditional: Event Date required when Event Flag ≠ NONE;
    │   Cessation Reason required when Amount = ₦0 AND Event Flag = NONE;
    │   all-or-nothing: any row fails → entire submission rejected with per-row error
    │   referencing field names and row numbers)
    ▼
[3] submissionService.ts → BEGIN TRANSACTION [INSIDE tx]
    │  → INSERT submission record (status: PROCESSING)
    │  → INSERT each row as submission_rows (immutable)
    │  → reconcileSubmission() — reconcile mid-cycle events against CSV rows [INSIDE tx]
    │     • matched events (same staff + event type + dates within 7 days) confirmed
    │     • date discrepancies flagged for Dept Admin reconciliation
    │     • unconfirmed mid-cycle events flagged as "Unconfirmed Event"
    │  → UPDATE submission with reconciliation summary
    │  → COMMIT
    ▼
[4] comparisonEngine.ts → compare MDA declared vs system computed [OUTSIDE tx]
    │  → categorise: CLEAN, MINOR_VARIANCE, FLAGGED, ALERT, INFO
    │  → wrapped in try/catch: failure does not invalidate submission
    ▼
[5] exceptionService.ts → auto-flag rows exceeding thresholds [OUTSIDE tx]
    │  → assign priority (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW) → INSERT exception records
    ▼
[6] emailService.ts → submission confirmation to MDA officer (fire-and-forget)
    │  → reconciliation alert to Dept Admin (if discrepancies found)
    │  → exception alerts to Dept Admin (if HIGH priority)
    ▼
[8] Dashboard hero metrics auto-updated on next TanStack Query refetch
```

### Data Flow: Early Exit Processing Lifecycle

```
Dept Admin initiates early exit for active loan
    │
    ▼
[1] earlyExitRoutes.ts → POST /early-exits/compute
    │  → earlyExitService.ts calls computationEngine:
    │     • remaining principal balance (from ledger)
    │     • current month interest (decimal.js)
    │     • total lump sum payoff amount
    │     • computation validity expiry date (last day of current month)
    │     • unique reference number (UUIDv7)
    │  → INSERT early_exit_computation record (status: COMPUTED)
    ▼
[2] Dept Admin records staff commitment
    │  → POST /early-exits/:id/commit
    │  → earlyExitService.ts records agreed payment deadline
    │  → UPDATE status → COMMITTED
    │  → emailService.ts → confirmation to Dept Admin
    ▼
[3a] Payment received before expiry:
    │  → POST /early-exits/:id/pay (amount, date, payment reference)
    │  → earlyExitService.ts verifies amount ≥ payoff
    │  → BEGIN TRANSACTION
    │     → INSERT lump sum ledger entry (immutable)
    │     → UPDATE loan status → COMPLETED
    │     → UPDATE early exit status → CLOSED
    │     → Trigger Auto-Stop Certificate generation
    │     → COMMIT
    │  → emailService.ts → Auto-Stop Certificate to beneficiary + MDA
    ▼
[3b] Expiry without payment:
    │  → node-cron job checks expiry dates nightly
    │  → earlyExitService.ts marks EXPIRED (retained in audit history)
    │  → Committed but unpaid flagged as attention item for Dept Admin
    │  → New computation required for updated payoff amount
```

### Data Flow: Mid-Cycle Employment Event

```
MDA Officer or Dept Admin files mid-cycle event
    │
    ▼
[1] employmentEventRoutes.ts → POST /employment-events
    │  → validate(eventFilingSchema): 5 fields
    │     • Staff ID (with name/MDA lookup confirmation)
    │     • Event Type (Retired, Deceased, Suspended, Absconded, Transferred Out,
    │       Dismissed, LWOP Start, LWOP End, Service Extension)
    │     • Effective Date
    │     • Reference Number (required for Retirement, Transfer, Dismissal)
    │     • Notes (optional)
    ▼
[2] employmentEventService.ts
    │  → INSERT employment_event record
    │  → Update staff loan status immediately
    │  → If Retired: temporalValidationService validates computed retirement date
    │  → emailService.ts → confirmation to filing user
    ▼
[3] Next monthly CSV submission:
    │  → employmentEventService.ts reconciles events against CSV rows:
    │     • Matched (same staff + event type + dates within 7 days) → auto-confirmed
    │     • Date discrepancy → flagged for Dept Admin reconciliation
    │     • Mid-cycle event not in CSV → "Unconfirmed Event" flag
    │     • CSV event with no prior mid-cycle report → accepted normally
```

### Data Flow: Observation Pipeline (Migration → Review)

```
Dept Admin uploads legacy spreadsheet
    │
    ▼
[1] migrationRoutes.ts → POST /migrations/upload + POST /migrations/:id/confirm
    │  → migrationService.ts parses, detects headers/eras, maps columns (FR90)
    │  → Extracts records into migration_records (Story 3.1)
    ▼
[1b] migrationRoutes.ts → POST /migrations/:id/validate
    │  → migrationValidationService.ts categorises records (FR26)
    │  → Computes effective rates, detects rate tier variances
    │  → Detects multi-MDA content (CDU-in-Agriculture pattern)
    │  → Stores variance_category, computed_rate, has_rate_variance per record
    ▼
[2] observationEngine.ts auto-scan after baseline creation (Story 3.6 — triggered after Story 3.4 baseline, or manually via API)
    │  → Rate Variance: compare each loan's effective rate against 13.33% standard
    │  → Stalled Balance: detect 3+ months unchanged balance (transfer-first hypothesis)
    │  → Negative Balance: flag computed balance < 0
    │  → Multi-MDA: cross-reference staff across all MDA records
    │  → No Approval Match: cross-reference against approved beneficiary lists (FR85)
    │  → Consecutive Loan: detect overlapping loan cycles for same staff
    │  → Each observation: compute data_completeness score (0-100%)
    │  → INSERT observation records (status: UNREVIEWED)
    ▼
[3] Dept Admin / Deputy AG reviews observations
    │  → GET /observations (filtered by type, MDA, status, staff)
    │  → ObservationCard displays factual description + explanations + suggested action
    │  → PATCH /observations/:id → mark as REVIEWED (with reviewer_note)
    ▼
[4a] Resolve: PATCH /observations/:id → mark as RESOLVED (with resolution note)
    ▼
[4b] Promote: POST /observations/:id/promote → creates exception record (Epic 7 handoff)
    │  → exceptionService receives promoted observation as new exception
```

### Gap Analysis

**Critical Gaps:** None.

**Deferred (documented with triggers):** Redis, BullMQ, API versioning, CDN, SMS provider, Sanity CMS (headless).

### Extension Points & Future Integration

> Cheap conventions now that make future integrations a bolt-on, not a rewrite. None of these add current code complexity — they are organisational patterns for the code already being written.

**1. Content Management Readiness (→ Sanity CMS)**

Public page content that may need non-developer editing is extracted to `src/content/*.ts` files:

```
apps/client/src/
├── content/                    # Static content — future CMS migration target
│   ├── about.ts               # Mission, vision, values, leadership roster (6 leaders w/ photos), governance
│   ├── news.ts                # Announcements (title, date, body, slug)
│   ├── faq.ts                 # Questions grouped by audience category
│   ├── downloads.ts           # Document list (name, format, url, status)
│   └── homepage.ts            # Endorsement quote, capabilities text
```

- **Today:** Components import from `content/*.ts`. Content changes = code commit + CI/CD deploy.
- **Future:** Components import from `useCmsContent()` hook → Sanity API. Content changes = edit in Sanity Studio.
- **Migration scope:** ~half day. Create Sanity schema → import content → swap imports for API calls. Zero template/layout changes.
- **CMS choice:** Sanity (free tier: 3 users, 100K API calls/month; TypeScript-first; GROQ queries; self-hostable Studio for data sovereignty).

**2. Data Ingestion Abstraction (→ State Payroll Database)**

The submission processing pipeline has a clean boundary between "receive/parse data" and "validate and write to ledger":

```
CSV Upload ──→ parse ──→ DeductionRecord[] ──→ validate ──→ ledger INSERT
                              ↑ clean boundary
Future Payroll API ──→ normalize ──→ DeductionRecord[] ──→ (same pipeline)
```

- **Convention:** `submissionService.processRecords(records: DeductionRecord[])` accepts normalised records regardless of source. The CSV parsing happens *before* this function in a separate ingestion adapter.
- **Future:** A `payrollAdapter.ts` normalises Payroll DB data into the same `DeductionRecord[]` shape. Validation and ledger logic untouched.
- **`DeductionRecord` interface** lives in `packages/shared/src/types/` — importable by any future adapter.

**3. API Consumer Readiness (→ Payroll Office, External Systems)**

- **Response envelope consistency:** All API responses use `{ data, meta, error }` envelope (already enforced). External consumers can use the same endpoints as the frontend.
- **API versioning path:** Routes are structured as `/api/route`. When external consumers arrive, prefix with `/api/v1/route`. Deferred until first external consumer (trigger: external system requests API access).
- **External auth slot:** Auth middleware checks JWT for human users. When external system access is needed, add API key authentication as a parallel auth strategy (same middleware chain, different token type). Do not embed frontend-specific concerns in API responses — return data, let consumers decide presentation.

**4. Domain Isolation (→ AG Office Platform Expansion)**

| Infrastructure (domain-agnostic, reusable) | Domain (vehicle-loan-specific) |
|---|---|
| Auth / JWT / sessions (`lib/jwt.ts`, `middleware/authenticate.ts`) | Computation engine (`services/computationEngine.ts`) |
| RBAC middleware (`middleware/authorise.ts`) | Loan tier parameters (`shared/constants/`) |
| Audit logging (`middleware/auditLog.ts`) | Submission CSV parsing (`services/submissionService.ts`) |
| Email service (`services/emailService.ts`) | Auto-Stop logic (`services/autoStopService.ts`) |
| PDF generation | Vehicle Loan Committee rules |
| Immutable ledger pattern (`db/schema.ts` ledger tables) | MDA monthly reporting |
| File upload / storage | Exception categorisation |

- **Convention:** Infrastructure services NEVER import from domain services. Domain services import from infrastructure.
- **RBAC is resource-based:** Permissions are `resource:action` pairs (`loan:read`, `submission:create`), not hardcoded loan-specific checks. Adding a new domain = adding new resource permissions, not rewriting auth.
- **Database namespacing:** Vehicle loan tables use clear domain names (`loans`, `ledger_entries`, `mda_submissions`). Future domains use their own namespace (`staff_advances`, `procurement_*`, etc.).
- **Future:** A new AG Office module (e.g., "Staff Advance Tracking") reuses auth + audit + ledger + email + PDF. Only needs new domain services.

**5. Event Emission Pattern (→ Webhooks, Message Queues)**

Key domain events are emitted as named events within the application:

```typescript
// services/eventBus.ts — simple typed event emitter (Node EventEmitter wrapper)
type DomainEvents = {
  'loan.completed': { loanId: string; staffId: string; mdaId: string };
  'submission.processed': { submissionId: string; mdaId: string; period: string };
  'autostop.triggered': { loanId: string; certificateId: string };
  'exception.flagged': { exceptionId: string; priority: string };
};
```

- **Today:** Events consumed internally (e.g., `loan.completed` triggers Auto-Stop Certificate generation + notification).
- **Future:** Events forwarded to webhook endpoints or message queues (BullMQ, already on deferred list) for external system consumption.
- **Convention:** All service methods that complete a significant workflow emit a domain event. Listeners are registered in a central `eventListeners.ts` file.

### Architecture Readiness Assessment

**Overall Status:** READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

**Confidence Level:** High

**Key Strengths:**
1. 3-layer immutable ledger defence — banking-grade financial data protection
2. Shared TypeScript types — prevents frontend/backend drift on financial data
3. Non-punitive vocabulary enforcement — systemically embedded, single source of truth
4. Solo developer optimised — monorepo, Docker, CI/CD, shared configs
5. Audit transparency — all auth and financial logic custom, inspectable, no black boxes
6. Temporal validation chain — retirement date computation, tenure checks, gratuity projections all derived from authoritative dates
7. Early exit state machine — deterministic workflow (Computed→Committed→Paid→Closed) with expiry safety net

**Implementation Handoff — First Priorities:**
1. Scaffold monorepo (pnpm workspace, tsconfig, ESLint, Prettier, Docker)
2. Database schema (Drizzle schema with immutability triggers, temporal profile fields, employment events, early exit computations)
3. Auth system (JWT + bcrypt + RBAC middleware)
4. Computation engine (including retirement date computation and early exit payoff calculations)
