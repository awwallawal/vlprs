# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Epic Status:
#   - backlog: Epic not yet started
#   - in-progress: Epic actively being worked on
#   - done: All stories in epic completed
#
# Epic Status Transitions:
#   - backlog -> in-progress: Automatically when first story is created (via create-story)
#   - in-progress -> done: Manually when all stories reach 'done' status
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file
#   - ready-for-dev: Story file created in stories folder
#   - in-progress: Developer actively working on implementation
#   - review: Ready for code review (via Dev's code-review workflow)
#   - done: Story completed
#
# Retrospective Status:
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#   - done: Retrospective has been completed
#
# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Epic transitions to 'in-progress' automatically when first story is created
# - Stories can be worked in parallel if team capacity allows
# - SM typically creates next story after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review', then runs code-review (fresh context, different LLM recommended)
#
# RETROSPECTIVE DISCIPLINE (from OSLRS playbook):
# - Each retrospective MUST review action items from the PREVIOUS retro first
# - Mark each prior action item as: done, irrelevant, or carried forward
# - Carried items get assigned to specific upcoming stories
# - Code review is adversarial: reviewer must find minimum 3 issues (High/Medium/Low)
# - All High + Medium findings must be resolved before merge
#
# STORY SIZING GUARDRAIL:
# - If a story exceeds 15 tasks during breakdown, split it before starting
# - Signs: >3 new components, both API + frontend spanning multiple entities, "and also..." keeps appearing
#
# UAT CHECKPOINTS:
# - Schedule structured UAT after every 2-3 stories (not just at epic completion)
# - Client has live URL access — send "What to Test" checklist after each milestone
# - Three-layer quality: Unit/Integration (Vitest) → E2E (Playwright) → Structured UAT (client)
